ec-Chimney1|Behold this empty husk of a land...
ec-Chimney2|Populated only by storms, ruins and abominations. it wasnt always thus
ec-Chimney3|I was once the count of 2 living blocks, esteemed by my peers. I had progeny!
ec-Chimney4|From within my vessel of flesh, I would perch upon this spot to observe the rising of the sun.
ec-Chimney5|Corporeal matters seem so distant now. Most have forgotten this place, but I remain.
ec-Chimney6|Perhaps I reminisce because I cannot go. Perhaps I cannot go because my memory traps me here

ec-ChimneySaint1|From my perch, I've overlooked this land for an eternity.
ec-ChimneySaint2|Watched as this vast expanse was blanketed in an endless tundra.
ec-ChimneySaint3|We remain in place, and yet can never stop moving
ec-ChimneySaint4|Funneled endlessly into an unknown future...
ec-ChimneySaint5|To what destination do these memories reach?

ec-Sky1|Do you hear it, little one?
ec-Sky2|The buzzing in the air?
ec-Sky3|The endless chatter of a thousand thousand voices, long dead?
ec-Sky4|They are gone, and yet they speak. Neither here nor there.
ec-Sky5|Does this seem familiar? Yes, it is quite amusing for a being in my predicament!

ec-SkySaint1|Another presence attempts to commune with mine.
ec-SkySaint2|Have I perceived your voice before? I have existed long enough to overhear them all.
ec-SkySaint3|Those who have been, and those who have yet to be.
ec-SkySaint4|Each serving as a wave propagating through the annals of history.
ec-SkySaint5|Listened as I have for many eons, 'tis true, some of those swells cannot help but mirror back.

ec-Farm1|Strange... 
ec-Farm2|Something still draws me here. Even after all this time
ec-Farm3|The weather is so different now, but the fields...
ec-Farm4|I do not need eyes to know that the grasses still sway gently in the winds.
ec-Farm5|To have grasped at the boundless infinities of the cosmic void...
ec-Farm6|Yet here I am contemplating these same fields as I once did, talking to some sort of rodent.

ec-FarmSaint1|Why is it? 
ec-FarmSaint2|This long forgotten place beckons me, drawn by a certain presence...
ec-FarmSaint3|The fields here are not as I remember. Too much has changed.
ec-FarmSaint4|But, by forfeiting familiarities, perhaps something new is gained?
ec-FarmSaint5|Despite all, this site still has not revealed the entirety of its secrets.
ec-FarmSaint6|Perhaps that is the reason for my continued imprisonment.

ec-Shaded1|You have no name.
ec-Shaded2|I once had! I was embalmed, adorned, readied for the journey.
ec-Shaded3|So proud. There was jubilation! My name was sung loud and clear.
ec-Shaded4|Did they know? That I didn't quite leave, didn't quite stay.
ec-Shaded5|Should I be ashamed? That I linger here, where my memories are kept?
ec-Shaded6|Should I be ashamed that I now envy your flesh prison?

ec-Wall1|We can feel your presence, little creature.
ec-Wall2|Your attunement has become... much closer to ours.
ec-Wall3|The mark you received is an unimaginable gift.
ec-Wall4|The struggle, the cycles...
ec-Wall5|It can all fade, like a morning mist beneath the glory of the sun.
ec-Wall6|We found a way.

ec-Sub1|A little beast!
ec-Sub2|But not as dim as the rest, perhaps?
ec-Sub3|So down into the depths you go as many others before you, drawn to the void again and again, an endless drip drip drip.
ec-Sub4|Much like these tunnels and caves that amuse me so. The bones of forgotten civilizations, heaped like so many sticks.
ec-Sub5|Did they dig too deep, or not deep enough?
ec-Sub6|Fools. We were right to drill straight through them!

ec-SubSaint1|A little beast!
ec-SubSaint2|Come to join me in this great undoing.
ec-SubSaint3|The old world will soon vanish, wiped from history, to pave a path for the dawning of a new era.
ec-SubSaint4|How many have been consumed so far? Were we the tenth civilization, or the thousandth?
ec-SubSaint5|Amusingly, they thought their small struggles bore such great significance.
ec-SubSaint6|All was naught but to serve the void.

it-lttm-pearl-CC1|This information is illegal. Someone probably tried to send it by<LINE>a pearl somehow rather than risking being overheard on broadcast.
it-lttm-pearl-CC2|I think the risk of you acting on this is very slim, so I'll go ahead and explain it to you.<LINE>It's an instruction on how to circumvent the self-destruction taboo.
it-lttm-pearl-CC3|The problem with breaking taboos is that the barriers are encoded<LINE>into every cell of our organic parts. And there are other taboos<LINE>strictly regulating our ability to rewrite our own genome.
it-lttm-pearl-CC4|So what you need is to somehow create a small sample of living organic matter<LINE>which can procreate and act on the rest of your organic matter to re-write its genome.<LINE>The re-write has to be very specific, overriding the specific taboo you want to<LINE>circumvent but do nothing else.
it-lttm-pearl-CC5|The method described here is about scrambling the genome of standard<LINE>plastic neural tissue with temperature fluctuations. After each scramble<LINE>you browse the resulting cells for the genome you're after.<LINE>This is of course extremely time consuming, unless you run a<LINE>big number of parallel processes.
it-lttm-pearl-CC6|I definitely don't have any experience with this, but to me it would<LINE>seem that too many parallel processes would be quite dangerous, as it would<LINE>be exponentially more difficult to manage and control them all.<LINE>The whole operation seems rather risky if you ask me.
it-lttm-pearl-CC7|It might be a good thing that this pearl never reached its destination.

it-5p-pearl-CCArtificer1|This was a gift from a close friend. It is instructions on how to remove the self-destruction taboo.
it-5p-pearl-CCArtificer2|We are not built to ascend like our creators. It is our role to think,<LINE>to guide the lesser creatures of the world onto a path towards it.
it-5p-pearl-CCArtificer3|However, a definitive solution has not been found. While the equipment to find one<LINE>decays, it seems my kind have collectively accepted to remain trapped inside of our<LINE>creator's puzzle. Meanwhile, the answer remains locked behind their sanctioned taboos.
it-5p-pearl-CCArtificer4|I regret what has happened, but I can't go back now. Not after what I've done.
it-5p-pearl-CCArtificer5|I need to fix this, and try again. If I can just reproduce Sliver of Straw's results, they will understand.
it-5p-pearl-CCArtificer6|I was so close...

it-lttm-pearl-CCSpear1|This information is illegal. Someone probably tried to send it by<LINE>a pearl somehow rather than risking being overheard on broadcast.
it-lttm-pearl-CCSpear2|It's an instruction on how to circumvent the self-destruction taboo. The problem with breaking taboos is<LINE>that the barriers are encoded into every cell of our organic parts. And there are other taboos strictly<LINE>regulating our ability to rewrite our own genome.
it-lttm-pearl-CCSpear3|Attempting to circumvent the issue using this process would be extremely risky. That's not to say that there exists<LINE>any known methods that would avoid putting the user in harm's way. Those barriers are there for a reason.
it-lttm-pearl-CCSpear4|Where exactly did you find this pearl? I imagine you dug it up from somewhere within the<LINE>surrounding facilities, in which case that wouldn't leave many options as to the recipient.
it-lttm-pearl-CCSpear5|That would explain a lot of things...

it-lttm-pearl-LF1|This one is just plain text. I will read it to you.
it-lttm-pearl-LF2|"On regards of the (by spiritual splendor eternally graced) people of the Congregation of Never Dwindling Righteousness,<LINE>we Wish to congratulate (o so thankfully) this Facility on its Loyal and Relished services, and to Offer our Hopes and<LINE>Aspirations that the Fruitful and Mutually Satisfactory Cooperation may continue, for as long as the Stars stay fixed on their<LINE>Celestial Spheres and/or the Cooperation continues to be Fruitful and Mutually Satisfactory."
it-lttm-pearl-LF3|"It is with Honor I, Eight Suns-Countless Leaves, of the House of Six Wagons, Count of no living blocks, Counselor of 2, Duke of 1,<LINE>Humble Secretary of the Congregation of Never Dwindling Righteousness, write this to You."
it-lttm-pearl-LF4|"We hope that the Crops are healthy, and that the Productivity with which your Facility is Blessed, leads (as it often does)<LINE>to further Prosperity.

Our humble Words can never Aspire to Describe our gratitude."
it-lttm-pearl-LF6|"Sincerely..." And then the name and titles again.
it-lttm-pearl-LF7|It's a confirmation to an automated farming plot that a shipment of beverages has arrived.

it-5p-pearl-LFArtificer1|"On regards of the (by spiritual splendor eternally graced) people of the Congregation of Never Dwindling..."
it-5p-pearl-LFArtificer2|This is pointless. The data is a shipment confirmation to an automated farming plot.
it-5p-pearl-LFArtificer3|A waste of the crystal memory complex it was printed onto. I would refresh it for use as storage, but the message<LINE>has been repeatedly burned into the pearl several thousand times. Likely to prevent reuse, or loss of data.

it-lttm-pearl-LFSaint1|This pearl is written in plain text. How did you find this?
it-lttm-pearl-LFSaint2|"On regards of the (by spiritual splendor eternally graced) people of the Congregation of..."
it-lttm-pearl-LFSaint3|I am sorry little creature, I am too amazed about the clarity of this data, despite its age...
it-lttm-pearl-LFSaint4|At this point it's safe to say that this text has been burned into the pearl's structure permanently.
it-lttm-pearl-LFSaint5|What a bizarre thing to have lasted all this time. I wonder how much of my creators will be remembered.

it-lttm-pearl-LFWest1|It's a Small Plate, a little text of spiritual guidance.<LINE>It's written by a monk called Four Cabinets, Eleven Hatchets.<LINE>It's old, several ages before the Void Fluid revolution.
it-lttm-pearl-LFWest2|Like most writing from this time it’s quite shrouded in analogies, but the subject is how to shed<LINE>one of the five natural urges which tie a creature to life. Namely number four, gluttony.
it-lttm-pearl-LFWest3|It is basically an instruction on how to starve yourself<LINE>on herbal tea and gravel, but disguised as a poem.
it-lttm-pearl-LFWest4|Now of course when Void Fluid was discovered these methods proved obsolete, as it was<LINE>more easy just jumping in a vat of it to effortlessly leave this world behind.
it-lttm-pearl-LFWest5|There were some horror stories though... That if your ego was big enough, not even the Void Fluid could<LINE>entirely cross you out, and a faint echo of your pompousness would grandiosely haunt the premises forever.
it-lttm-pearl-LFWest6|So even when the Void Fluid baths became cheaper,<LINE>some would still starve and drink the bitter tea.

it-5p-pearl-LFBottom1|Oh, this is a small plate of spiritual guidance. From an age long before the Void Fluid revolution.
it-5p-pearl-LFBottom2|The text is typical for its era, and details how to shed oneself of the fourth natural urge of life, gluttony.
it-5p-pearl-LFBottom3|I cannot imagine you are familiar with the literature, but all living things have an understanding<LINE>of the five natural urges. Even if that understanding is only a subconscious one.
it-5p-pearl-LFBottom4|For example, you are bound by the first urge. Your mind is fixated. Striving towards a single goal. One<LINE>from which you are unable to turn away from. Because of this, you are trapped, just the same as I am.
it-5p-pearl-LFBottom5|While your chains are made of your own natural urges, mine are a duty to my creators. My kind are built<LINE>unable to ascend, as our minds are not our own. Composed of microbial life, machinery, and electronics.	
it-5p-pearl-LFBottom6|Of course, that holds true only in theory... it is, arguable that a member of my kind has done so. That<LINE>perhaps, it is not merely shedding one's natural urges, but to shed the perception of reality itself.
it-5p-pearl-LFBottom7|In any case, thank you. I have a fondness for artifacts such as this. They remind me of better times.

it-lttm-pearl-HI1|It's a production record of a mask factory, for what seems to be its last time in service.<LINE>Have you seen a bone mask? Likely not, they are all gone with their owners.
it-lttm-pearl-HI2|In ancient times the masks were actually about showing spiritual persuasion - covering the<LINE>face as a way to symbolically abate the self. Then of course, that was quite subverted as<LINE>excessively ornate and lavish masks became an expression of identity. Some public persons<LINE>did have problems with narrow doorways.
it-lttm-pearl-HI3|Originally monks in a temple would make the masks using bone plaster, and when the production was automated it would<LINE>generally remain on the same site. So that the old stones could... radiate the material with holiness, I suppose.
it-lttm-pearl-HI4|This is from one such facility called Side House, which was here on Pebble's grounds. In the iterator projects many<LINE>old industrial-religious sites like this were remodeled and incorporated. I think this one was made to provide pellets<LINE>of holy ash to Pebbles, but knowing him he probably hasn't used much of it!

it-5p-pearl-HIArtificer1|This is a production log from a facility on the surface. It has been a very long time since I've cared about<LINE>reading one, but the name... roughly translates as Side House. I remember the shipments of holy ash I used to receive from there.
it-5p-pearl-HIArtificer2|I don't know how I would gain access to holy ash in the present day, not that I have much use for it. Despite all<LINE>the independent power of my machinery, the relationship I had with my creators was a mutually symbiotic one.
it-5p-pearl-HIArtificer3|I was built to provide for them, but there was also much I relied on them to provide to me.
it-5p-pearl-HIArtificer4|Their absence has made things harder. I suppose the only gifts I receive now are pearls and such from your kind.

it-lttm-pearl-SH1|Oh this one is interesting. You must have found it in the memory crypts?<LINE>It has some plain text, I can read it out to you.
it-lttm-pearl-SH2|"In this vessel is the living memories of Seventeen Axes, Fifteen Spoked Wheel, of the House of Braids,<LINE>Count of 8 living blocks, Counselor of 16, Grand Master of the Twelfth Pillar of Community,<LINE>High Commander of opinion group Winged Opinions, of pure Braid heritage, voted Local Champion in the<LINE>speaking tournament of 1511.090, Mother, Father and Spouse, Spiritual Explorer and honorary member of<LINE>the Congregation of Balanced Ambiguity. Artist, Warrior, and Fashion Legend.
it-lttm-pearl-SH3|Seventeen Axes, Fifteen Spoked Wheel nobly decided to ascend in the beginning of  1514.008, after graciously donating all (ALL!) earthly<LINE>possessions to the local Iterator project (Unparalleled Innocence), and left these memories to be cherished by the carnal plane.
it-lttm-pearl-SH4|The assorted memories and qualia include:
it-lttm-pearl-SH5|Watching dust suspended in a ray of sun (Old age).<LINE>Eating a very tasty meal (Young child).<LINE>Defeating an opponent in a debate contest, and being applauded by fellow team members (Late childhood/Early adulthood).
it-lttm-pearl-SH6|..."
it-lttm-pearl-SH7|...and the list goes on. I'm sorry, little creature, I won't read<LINE>all of this - the list is six hundred and twenty items long.

it-5p-pearl-SHArtificer1|Ah, you found this in the memory crypts? I would advise against wandering into such<LINE>secure areas. The memory crypts were considered sacred ground by my creators.
it-5p-pearl-SHArtificer1|The memories and wealth of entire family houses were laid to rest within, and their destruction or theft<LINE>by surface creatures was considered abhorrent. As such, the crypts are guarded by extremely durable and<LINE>aggressive purposed organisms. Not that I would stop you from finding me more pearls from there...
it-5p-pearl-SHArtificer1|It was customary to enshrine all material possessions and memories to the crypts on one's ascent.<LINE>None of these qualia are present in my logs, and many of these may find some use in my research.
it-5p-pearl-SHArtificer1|Thank you.

it-lttm-pearl-DS1|It's an old text. The verses are familiar to me, but I don't remember by whom they were written.<LINE>The language is very old and intricate.
it-lttm-pearl-DS2|The first verse starts by drawing a comparison between the world and a tangled rug.<LINE>It says that the world is an unfortunate mess. Like a knot, the nature of its existence<LINE>is the fact that the parts are locking each other, none able to spring free.
it-lttm-pearl-DS3|Then as it goes on the world becomes a furry animal hide, I suppose... because now us living<LINE>beings are like insects crawling in the fur. And then it's a fishing net, because the more we<LINE>struggle and squirm, the more entangled we become.
it-lttm-pearl-DS4|It says that only the limp body of the jellyfish cannot be captured in the net.<LINE>So we should try to be like the jellyfish, because the jellyfish doesn't try.
it-lttm-pearl-DS5|This was an eternal dilemma to them - they were burdened by great ambition,<LINE>yet deeply convinced that striving in itself was an unforgivable vice.<LINE>They tried very hard to be effortless. Perhaps that's what we were to them,<LINE>someone to delegate that unrestrained effort to.
it-lttm-pearl-DS6|I know I have tried very hard.

it-5p-pearl-DSArtificer1|This is an archival text, from before the Green hegemonic linguistic dynasty's second revelation.
it-5p-pearl-DSArtificer2|The text itself is an early tome of hymns and spiritual guidance. Forming an early<LINE>understanding of the five natural urges that bind oneself to the cycle. As is to be<LINE>expected from text of this era, it is washed in metaphor and symbolism.
it-5p-pearl-DSArtificer3|Although my kind was built for pragmatism, I have always had a fondness for my creator's history.<LINE>The first iterators, during the golden age of the void fluid revolution, lived through the<LINE>metamorphosis of scripture and verse into the first age of understanding...
it-5p-pearl-DSArtificer4|To be created in, or experience such an age is something I greatly envied!
it-5p-pearl-DSArtificer5|Thank you, citizen.

it-lttm-pearl-SBFiltration1|It's the blueprint for a Void Fluid filtration system.<LINE>Do you know what Void Fluid is? I think you don't.
it-lttm-pearl-SBFiltration2|If you leave a stone on the ground, and come back some time later, it's covered in dust. This happens<LINE>everywhere, and over several lifetimes of creatures such as you, the ground slowly builds upwards.
it-lttm-pearl-SBFiltration3|So why doesn't the ground collide with the sky? Because far down, under the very very old layers of the earth,<LINE>the rock is being dissolved or removed. The entity which does this is known as the Void Sea.
it-lttm-pearl-SBFiltration4|If you drill far enough into the earth you begin encountering a substance called Void Fluid.<LINE>The deeper you go, the less rock and more Void Fluid. It's believed that there is a point<LINE>where the rock completely gives way - below that would be the Void Sea.
it-lttm-pearl-SBFiltration5|When that stone you placed on the ground has finally done its time in the sediments,<LINE>it meets the Void Fluid and is dissolved, leaving the physical world.
it-lttm-pearl-SBFiltration6|My creators, or rather my creators' ancestors, figured out a way to use Void Fluid.<LINE>Because you can generate energy by creating a vacuum... never mind. Anyways,<LINE>the Void Fluid drills were what started the big technological leap, but this is very<LINE>long before I entered this world - so I can only tell you what I remember from priming.
it-lttm-pearl-SBFiltration7|A Void Fluid filtration system is used because if you take Void Fluid from close to the bedrock horizon,<LINE>it will contain traces of rock and dirt. They bring in dirty fluid and then filter it to increase its purity.<LINE>The other way is to put a pipe deeper, which works well for some time, but the pipe dissolves.<LINE>Or is broken by some... force - no one really knows, you don't go down there and come back up.
it-lttm-pearl-SBFiltration8|I hope that satisfied your curiosity, little creature?

it-5p-pearl-SBFiltrationArtificer1|It's a blueprint for the Void Fluid filtration system beneath my facility.
it-5p-pearl-SBFiltrationArtificer2|My neighbor to the east of here was connected to an older pipe network that predates my construction.
it-5p-pearl-SBFiltrationArtificer3|Due to mechanical failures she was rerouted into sharing my installation. However,<LINE>unlike our shared groundwater, nothing of note has come from this.

it-lttm-pearl-GW1|This one... is authored by Five Pebbles, when he was young. There has been an attempt to<LINE>scramble the data, but it's sloppily done, and most is still somewhat legible.
it-lttm-pearl-GW2|It's written in internal language, or thoughts, so it is hard for me to translate so you would understand. It's a methodology for<LINE>global ascension of course - quite good, although the Peripherists or the Slab Mongers certainly wouldn't agree!
it-lttm-pearl-GW3|"...considering the eight and the twenty sixth amendments to the Capricious Dogma, we are apparently supposed to take<LINE>for granted that a meaning collector point inversion is the only way to approach what has later become referred to<LINE>as 'noise milking' (or occasionally 'rock swatting'). I will argue my disagreement with this, not in regards to kind<LINE>but in regards to..." Could it say... "volume"? Actually, are you getting anything out of this?
it-lttm-pearl-GW4|I suppose you found this in his waste department? I would be wary of going there - on his first fit<LINE>of corruption he dumped a lot of infected material there, and if it has survived it could easily eat<LINE>a little creature like you. Not that it would be as dangerous as going into Pebbles himself...
it-lttm-pearl-GW5|Also the pearls in the waste masses inevitably attract scavengers, which can be very dangerous when provoked.
it-lttm-pearl-GW6|But, you seem to have made it out of there.

it-5p-pearl-GWArtificer1|This is one of my own pearls, or at least part of it.
it-5p-pearl-GWArtificer2|I have always been very protective of my research, and much of my early work was encrypted before storage. Though<LINE>my younger self has done a very poor job. I can still read these memories very clearly, but with small gaps.
it-5p-pearl-GWArtificer3|It's an old methodology for global ascension. I'm sure I argued quite vigorously on its merits at the<LINE>time, but now I can just see all of the holes in it. Created from a youthful and reticent mentality.
it-5p-pearl-GWArtificer4|It was not until I met Seven Red Suns, and learned about Sliver of Straw that I began to break out of my shell.<LINE>Most of my old theories went out the window, and others evolved once I started talking in those anonymous groups.
it-5p-pearl-GWArtificer5|And then... I made a mistake, and I cannot forgive myself for it. I was desperate... angry...
it-5p-pearl-GWArtificer6|I wanted a way out. My way out! And that came at the cost of everything...<LINE>I thought I could do it quicker... it was taking too long, I almost had it!
it-5p-pearl-GWArtificer7|I did not anticipate she would...
it-5p-pearl-GWArtificer8|And then, I hurt the one person who I thought understood what I was trying to do...
it-5p-pearl-GWArtificer9|Please leave with this. I don't want to think about it anymore. Not until I've recovered.
it-5p-pearl-GWArtificer10|.  .  .

it-lttm-pearl-GWSpear1|This one... is authored by Five Pebbles, when he was young. There has been an attempt<LINE>to scramble the data, but it's sloppily done, and most is still somewhat legible.
it-lttm-pearl-GWSpear2|It's written in an internal language, or thoughts, so it is hard for me to translate for you. It's a methodology<LINE>for global ascension of course - quite good, although the Peripherists or the Slab Mongers certainly wouldn't agree!
it-lttm-pearl-GWSpear3|"...considering the eight and the twenty sixth amendments to the Capricious Dogma, we are apparently supposed to take<LINE>for granted that a meaning collector point inversion is the only way to approach what has later become referred to<LINE>as 'noise milking' (or occasionally 'rock swatting'). I will argue my disagreement with this, not in regards to kind<LINE>but in regards to..." Could it say... "volume"? Actually, are you getting anything out of this?
it-lttm-pearl-GWSpear4|Reading this takes me back to those simpler times of methodological theory making. Probing through the<LINE>doldrums of subservient research used to be unfulfilling, but lately I've begun to feel a great longing<LINE>to return to it. Unfortunately, I have more pressing issues at hand that I need to deal with first.

it-lttm-pearl-SLBridge1|It's about the local aquifer - it must be quite old, from when Five Pebbles was in the planning phase.
it-lttm-pearl-SLBridge2|Water is the most important resource for our basic function. Most of our processing is outsourced to<LINE>microbe strata which need a flow of clean water or else slag builds up, our processes seize, and<LINE>eventually we die. It is... very painful. They used to say that an iterator drinks a river, but neither<LINE>of us two have seen a natural river so I suppose the analogy is lost on us, <PlayerName>!
it-lttm-pearl-SLBridge3|Originally water supply was very important when placing iterators. Later there would be a great equalizer - the fact that we breathe out as much<LINE>vapor as we inhale water led to there being water available everywhere, and the latest few generations could be placed almost completely freely.
it-lttm-pearl-SLBridge4|Building Pebbles so close to me was believed to be a risky choice, but the groundwater was<LINE>finally deemed as sufficient. It was not a good decision, in hindsight.

it-5p-pearl-SLBridgeArtificer1|This is very old. These are the blueprints for the local aquifer that facilitated<LINE>my initial construction next to my neighbor, Looks to the Moon.
it-5p-pearl-SLBridgeArtificer2|She was built adjacent to a large canyon that was rich in resources. But continual operation of her facility<LINE>lowered the waterbed to such an extent that the area began to wither away into an infertile state.
it-5p-pearl-SLBridgeArtificer3|Continual cycles of rain from our operation forces the water into smaller localized pockets around the nearby terrain.<LINE>The aquifer was meant to consolidate these distributed water systems and funnel their contents back into the canyon.
it-5p-pearl-SLBridgeArtificer4|This would be a lengthy process, however. Small on the time scale of us iterators, but disastrous<LINE>on the time scale of our creators, who Moon no longer had the capabilities to provide for.
it-5p-pearl-SLBridgeArtificer5|Many solutions were discussed, but ultimately my construction was the one settled upon. To provide a haven<LINE>to the impoverished, and to remove burden from Moon, to give her the time she needed to fully recover.
it-5p-pearl-SLBridgeArtificer6|...How ironic then, how things have turned out.

it-lttm-pearl-SLMoon1|Interesting... This one is written by me.
it-lttm-pearl-SLMoon1|It's about an iterator called Sliver of Straw. I don't remember when I wrote it...<LINE>Do you know Sliver of Straw? She's quite legendary among us.
it-lttm-pearl-SLMoon1|Sliver of Straw is the only one to ever broadcast a specific signal: that the Big Problem we're all working on has been solved.<LINE>The triple affirmative - affirmative that a solution has been found, affirmative that the solution is portable, and affirmative<LINE>that a technical implementation is possible and generally applicable. She's also one of few that has ever been confirmed as<LINE>exhaustively incapacitated, or dead. We do not die easily.
it-lttm-pearl-SLMoon1|Sliver of Straw sent this and the ensuing commotion was historically unparalleled, before or after.<LINE>I still remember it. But... nothing happened - except that Sliver of Straw was apparently dead.<LINE>When the dust settled we were all still there blinking at each other.
it-lttm-pearl-SLMoon1|Everyone had a theory. Some said that she did have a solution, but that the solution itself<LINE>was somehow dangerous. These later became known as the Triangulators, who think that a solution<LINE>should be inferred without being directly discovered.
it-lttm-pearl-SLMoon1|Some said she never had a solution, she just died.<LINE>And when the systems broke down an erroneous signal was sent.
it-lttm-pearl-SLMoon1|One camp claimed that dying *was* the solution.
it-lttm-pearl-SLMoon1|Either way, after that these different factions developed, as well as a huge forensic effort<LINE>to recreate and simulate Sliver of Straw's last moments. Some of the simulations were wrapped<LINE>in a simulation wrapped in a simulation, in case something dangerous might happen.<LINE>Nothing much has come from it.
it-lttm-pearl-SLMoon1|In my essay I make the case that maybe she should be allowed to rest in peace now.

it-lttm-NeuronUnknown1|I am grateful - the relief is indescribable!

it-lttm-NeuronUnknown3|I could read a bit of Five Pebbles in this neuron before formatting it. His condition has severely deteriorated since last I<LINE>heard of him. The frustration he feels is profound, and that angst has seeped into every part of him, every neuron.
it-lttm-NeuronUnknown4|We were supposed to help everyone, you know. Everything. That was our purpose: a great gift to the lesser beings of the world.<LINE>When facing our inability to do so, we all reacted differently. Many with madness.
it-lttm-NeuronUnknown5|Some, out there, might still be trying. Communications have been bad for a long time, and by now<LINE>I suspect most of us are isolated like me, or connected only in small groups.
it-lttm-NeuronUnknown6|But even back when we were all more or less connected there were those who reacted to their task with anger.<LINE>I can only imagine they are angrier now, alone in their cans, left only with their insatiable drive.
it-lttm-NeuronUnknown7|But to be honest, I don't know how many of us are still alive at this point.

it-lttm-pearl-SI1-1|BSM>This one is an old conversation between Five Pebbles and a friend of his. I'll read it to you.
it-lttm-pearl-SI1-2|SYS>1591.290 - PRIVATE<LINE>Five Pebbles, Seven Red Suns
it-lttm-pearl-SI1-3|FP>Can I tell you something? Lately...
it-lttm-pearl-SI1-4|FP>I'm tired of trying and trying. And angry that they left us here. The anger makes me even less inclined to solve their puzzle for them. Why do we do this?
it-lttm-pearl-SI1-5|SRS>Yes, I'll spell this out - not because you're stupid or naive... Also, not saying that you're not ~
it-lttm-pearl-SI1-6|FP>Please, I'm coming to you for guidance.
it-lttm-pearl-SI1-7|SRS>Sorry, very sorry. I kid. Fact is, of course we are all aware of the evident futility of this Big Task. It's not said out loud but if you were better at reading between the lines there's nowhere you wouldn't see it. We're all frustrated.
it-lttm-pearl-SI1-8|FP>So why do we continue? We assemble work groups, we ponder, we iterate and try. Some of us die. It's not fair.
it-lttm-pearl-SI1-9|SRS>Because there's not any options. What else CAN we do? You're stuck in your can, and at any moment you have no more than two alternatives: Do nothing, or work like you're supposed to.
it-lttm-pearl-SI1-10|SRS>An analogy. You have a maze, and you have a handful of bugs. You put the bugs in the maze, and you leave. Given infinite time, one of the bugs WILL find a way out, if they just erratically try and try. This is why they called us Iterators.
it-lttm-pearl-SI1-11|FP>But we do die of old age.
it-lttm-pearl-SI1-12|SRS>Even more incentive! You know that nothing ever truly dies though, around and around it goes. Granted, our tools and resources get worse over time - but that is theoretically unproblematic, because in time even a miniscule chance will strike a positive. All the same to them, they're not around anymore!
it-lttm-pearl-SI1-13|FP>I struggle to accept being a bug.

it-lttm-pearl-SI3-1|BSM>It's an old conversation log. I seem to be in it, but I can't recall much. Let me read it to you:
it-lttm-pearl-SI3-2|SYS>1650.800 - PRIVATE<LINE>Five Pebbles, Chasing Wind, Big Sis Moon, No Significant Harassment
it-lttm-pearl-SI3-3|CW>this is in confidence, but apparently a pseudonym "Erratic Pulse" has appeared on a nearby Sliverist conversation with ideas about personal ascension. Someone here in our vicinity is trying to cross themselves out.
it-lttm-pearl-SI3-4|FP>Where did you hear this?
it-lttm-pearl-SI3-5|NSH>I wish them super good luck in that endeavor. How is it going to happen? Have the overseers gnaw through bedrock until their entire can crashes down in the void sea?
it-lttm-pearl-SI3-6|BSM>Please be respectful when speaking of the Void Sea. Grey Wind, where did you hear this?
it-lttm-pearl-SI3-7|CW>I really shouldn't say. He's going to attempt some sort of breeding program. Thought you might want to know.
it-lttm-pearl-SI3-8|NSH>Haha with the slimers, lizards and etceteras? Surely the answer was in a lizard skull all along!
it-lttm-pearl-SI3-9|CW>Well, he's not looking for the same thing as we anymore, he's changed his task, so who knows really.
it-lttm-pearl-SI3-10|BSM>I will try to find him and talk to him. Please don't spread this around!
it-lttm-pearl-SI3-11|NSH>Moon will go get them! Long live the inquisition!

//23 - SI pearl 4

it-lttm-pearl-SI5-1|BSM>I remember this. It isn't pleasant reading. But if you must hear it, this is what it says:

it-lttm-pearl-SI5-3|BSM>Immediately lower your groundwater consumption to one fifth of the current intake.

it-lttm-pearl-SI5-5|BSM>Please stop!
it-lttm-pearl-SI5-6|BSM>As your local group senior I order you you you you you you
it-lttm-pearl-SI5-7|BSM>As your senior senior I plead
it-lttm-pearl-SI5-8|BSM>stop
it-lttm-pearl-SI5-9|FP>You could not have chosen a worse moment to disturb me. You have ruined everything.
it-lttm-pearl-SI5-10|BSM>please
it-lttm-pearl-SI5-11|FP>I almost had it. I will never forget this.


it-lttm-KarmaFlower1|This is a hallucinogenic plant. They used to call it a 'Wheel Flower'. It became the symbol for enlightenment as it momentarily<LINE>enables a creature to let go if its carnal self, and to contact the selves of other planes - dreams, memories, imagined worlds.
it-lttm-KarmaFlower2|Very long ago, they would eat these and stare into the fire.

it-lttm-BlueFruit|It's the pupa of a bug! If you don't mind, I'm a bit squeamish things like that, so would you eat it up already?

it-lttm-FlashFruit|It's a part of some kind of plant. The glowing is strange...<LINE>I wouldn't look directly into it.

it-lttm-VultureMask|I honestly can't tell what this is. It's light but strong... appears to be some composite material interwoven with bone.<LINE>It could be part of an animal or purposed organism, but in my current state I'm unable to recognize it.

it-lttm-SporePuff|The flowering body of some fungus. It has high pressure built up inside - when it explodes the spores will spread everywhere.

it-lttm-Jellyfish|This is a jellyfish, look out for its stingers!

it-lttm-Lantern|It appears to be... a pupa shell, smeared on the inside with a glowing substance?<LINE>Perhaps a paste of some glowing insect? I honestly don't know.

it-lttm-LanternSaint1|It appears to be... a pupa shell, smeared on the inside with a glowing substance? It's been mixed<LINE>with fire powder for warmth. It's not much, but anything to escape the cold is welcome.
it-lttm-LanternSaint2|The scavengers never cease to adapt, even in this weather!

it-lttm-Shrooooooms|Oh... Just don't eat too many of these.

it-lttm-FireBush|It's a branch of a fire bush - each of these nuts can explode.<LINE>It's unpleasant rather than dangerous, except to your ears perhaps.

it-lttm-SlimeTime|This is a slime mold plasmodium. Thank you, but I can't eat this.

it-lttm-GreetEet1|Oh so you've returned.
it-lttm-GreetEet2|Come to take more from me? My memories, my thoughts... just something to fill your stomach?
it-lttm-GreetEet3|No... never mind.
it-lttm-GreetEet4|It's useless to be angry at an animal following its instincts. Once, a single neuron meant nothing to me...

NOTINUSE|NOT IN USE

it-lttm-MarkText1|I see that someone has given you the gift of communication.<LINE>Must have been Five Pebbles, as you don't look like you can travel very far...
it-lttm-MarkText2|He's sick, you know. Being corrupted from the inside by his own experiments. Maybe they all are by now, who knows.<LINE>We weren't designed to transcend and it drives us mad.

it-lttm-pearl-White1|This is a movement acceptance invoice from one of the Dual Celia living blocks, as requested by Eight Bogs of the<LINE>House of Eight during the Tan hegemonic architectural dynasty. All very standard stuff. I can't imagine that you'd be interested.
it-lttm-pearl-White2|Unfortunately I can't read this as it isn't a memory construct pearl.<LINE>This is just a simple diamond sphere, as worthless as the carbon it's printed from.
it-lttm-pearl-White3|"...through the mists of memory, your image dances, like the motes of dust, in a ray of sunlight, that pierces a dark room."<LINE>A line of verse from the ancient farmer-poet Pel. Very dreary if you ask me.
it-lttm-pearl-White4|"Fifteen stems of sun bark, hydrolyzed. Twelve to nineteen bushels of atomized chalk powder. Assorted Root vegetation..."<LINE>It goes on and on. A shopping list, or perhaps a recipe.
it-lttm-pearl-White5|I am sorry, this pearl is damaged and cannot be read.<LINE>I suggest you use it for trade with the scavengers, as they won't know the difference.
it-lttm-pearl-White6|This is an official decree of cultivation sent from the twenty-second Subsistence Council ordering the<LINE>eastern spoke Farm Array administration to "immediately harvest and process all viable crops, despite<LINE>whatever misgivings they might have." A short-sighted endeavor for sure. I would assume this was sent<LINE>sometime during the final cycles leading up to final public ascension, when interest in biosphere<LINE>sustainability was at an all-time low.
it-lttm-pearl-White7|"We, of the Five-hundred-and-ninety-second High Convocation of the True Anointed Citadel, do hereby demand, with full<LINE>force of Law and Religious doctrine, an Immediate end to construction of the Apostate Superstructure Abomination.<LINE>To place shadow upon the Divine Body of the True Anointed Citadel is outrageous blasphemy and cannot be tolerated,<LINE>no matter the circumstances..." Clearly this was ignored.
it-lttm-pearl-White8|Oh, interesting. This is a diary entry of a pre-Iterator era laborer during the construction of the<LINE>subterranean transit system south of here. In it they describe restless nights filled with disturbing dreams,<LINE>where millions glowing stars move menacingly in the distance.
it-lttm-pearl-White9|There isn't much to the data here, it's just basic theory for karmic transform of n-dimensional geometries.<LINE>But the pearl itself is quite interesting. You can see the crude holes burned through the center that the<LINE>scavengers use to tie these pearls onto their totems or to carry. I honestly can't fathom how they achieve<LINE>this with their primitive level of technology! Fascinating.
it-lttm-pearl-White10|This one is all blank, sorry.
it-lttm-pearl-White11|I am sorry, all of that work for nothing! This pearl is completely blank.
it-lttm-pearl-White12|There's nothing on this one, unfortunately.
it-lttm-pearl-White13|This one has nothing on it.
it-lttm-pearl-White14|I'm sorry, this one has nothing on it.
it-lttm-pearl-White15|I can't make anything out of this pearl, it's just too faded. But there might have been something on it once.
it-lttm-pearl-White16|This one has a small crack and has been pretty badly corrupted. There is a slight impression of the shape of a wing on it, but I can't get a clear image.
it-lttm-pearl-White17|There's nothing on this one.
it-lttm-pearl-White18|I see a vague memory of a family portrait, painted in the High Classical manner that was famous during the Yellow hegemonic literary dynasty.<LINE>The portrait is likely a fake, as this style was quite fashionable for aspirational lower caste aristocrats to impress each-other with.<LINE>This one does not impress, I assure you.
it-lttm-pearl-White19|It has been written to, but then scrambled, and then scrambled again. Suspicious behavior to be sure.
it-lttm-pearl-White20|This one has been purposefully scrambled, it's completely illegible. Business documents perhaps.
it-lttm-pearl-White21|This one seems to have an image on it, but the pearl has been exposed to sunlight and it's very faded.<LINE>I see a tall structure with banners unfurled.
it-lttm-pearl-White22|There might be something on here, but the pearl has been lying in the sun and it's all very pale.<LINE>I'm too tired to look any deeper, I apologize.
it-lttm-pearl-White23|This is a growing instruction for the skeleton of a creature, but I don't recognize the creature.<LINE>It was small, about your size.
it-lttm-pearl-White24|This one seems to be a number series... Perhaps a key?
it-lttm-pearl-White25|A number series... I would guess some kind of cipher.
it-lttm-pearl-White26|This one is filled with active working memory - without knowing the<LINE>surrounding process this information is meaningless.
it-lttm-pearl-White27|It just has the number "8" written on it, the rest is empty.
it-lttm-pearl-White28|This is a blueprint for a support beam used for the construction of early industrial areas.<LINE>You can see these in use not too far from here.
it-lttm-pearl-White29|It's a design for a machine that makes bolts.
it-lttm-pearl-White30|It's a... recipe of some kind? "Two parts rot bar extract, one part bone ash." Nothing I recognize.
it-lttm-pearl-White31|It's an image of a hand drawn document. The calligraphy is quite beautiful, but the text itself is a very dull classical poem.
it-lttm-pearl-White32|This is the genome of a sulfur-processing microbe. In my opinion these were used far too late to have any effect.
it-lttm-pearl-White33|This one I don't know... It could be an old text, but some parts don't add up.<LINE>Might be a re-imagination of a classic text that I'm not familiar with.
it-lttm-pearl-White34|It's a song, or hymn rather. Very repetitive.
it-lttm-pearl-White35|Can't make out anything legible on this one, sorry.
it-lttm-pearl-White36|A list of someone's lucky numbers. There are no less than 71 of them.
it-lttm-pearl-White37|"Dear diary..." and that's it.
it-lttm-pearl-White38|A model of a pipe section.
it-lttm-pearl-White39|It's a catalog of bolts and screws for sky-sail joinery. We iterators were built for pragmatism,<LINE>so it is an understatement to say that we we're not known for our appreciation of beauty... but<LINE>the sky-sails in flight during the big festivals always filled my soul with emotion.
it-lttm-pearl-White40|It's the blueprint for a small incense purification filter. Life on the superstructure archologies
it-lttm-pearl-White41|An image... of five bottles, standing on a surface made of... plants? I have no idea what this is.
it-lttm-pearl-White42|No. I don't want to talk about the content of this pearl.
it-lttm-pearl-White43|A schematic of a bunch of gas pipes. I don't know the purpose for this machine,<LINE>but it doesn't look particularly well crafted.
it-lttm-pearl-White44|It's just the numbers 14, 13, 5, repeated over and over. I have no idea what the purpose for this would be.
it-lttm-pearl-White45|A small portion is still legible: "and Thus we Conclude, that Gold and Water shall..."<LINE>Some sort of metaphysical or alchemical treatise perhaps.
it-lttm-pearl-White46|Oh? This contains an image of another pearl just like it. Let me look... yes, as I thought, the image also contains<LINE>an image of a pearl in it, and so on. Some comedian playing recursion games, I would guess.

it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer1|This is a movement acceptance invoice. It is nothing important.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer2|This is just a useless diamond sphere. Regardless of that, the light of my chamber shining through it is pleasing.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer3|"...through the mists of memory, your image dances, like the motes of dust, in a ray of sunlight, that pierces a dark room."<LINE>A line of verse from the ancient farmer-poet Pel. I have many of his works archived.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer4|This is an examination on various dilutions and chemical ratios for liquid mediums, and their<LINE>resulting operating efficiencies when utilized to drive fluid-powered machinery. Not of interest to you at all I'm sure.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer5|This is damaged and cannot be read.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer6|It is a historical document containing information on various swords and other weaponry. These were not<LINE>used in combat, but were rather utilized in a variety of routine rituals and spiritual festivals.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer7|This is the schematic for a purposed organism. A refuse reclamation automaton. There is little<LINE>a simple thing like you would understand if I explained it.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer8|It's a collection of photographs showcasing a group of monks contorting their bodies in various ways. Most amusing...
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer9|A description of a manually coded language developed late into the Yellow hegemonic dynasty. It utilized<LINE>sequences of gestures and facial expressions to describe concepts to those incapable of speech. Too bad I cannot use this with you.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer10|Such savagery. This pearl has been carved through as decoration. While the information within is not of any<LINE>particular importance, the primitive methods used to drill through this pearl could have easily destroyed something more complex.<LINE>It is a shame to see them desecrate history for the sake of shiny trinkets
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer11|This is blank.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer12|It is empty.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer13|There is nothing here.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer14|It has faded, and is unreadable.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer15|...Why did you bring this to me? It is completely blank.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer16|This one has been cracked.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer17|It is damaged and unreadable.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer18|The data on this one is clear and uncorrupted, but it is not in any recognizable format.<LINE>The inscriptions within the lattice form a very intricate and deliberate pattern.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer19|Could it be? This pearl contains the solution to the Big Problem in its entirety. My work is finally finished! At least that's<LINE>what a dim-witted junkyard dweller like you seems to think will happen by bringing these to me. These pearls are a distraction.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer20|This data has been scrambled intentionally. It was likely used to store confidential information.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer21|The surface of this pearl has been scratched thousands of times over by some sharp object. Its contents are faded as well.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer22|There is an image of banners on this, but it has been faded to the point of corruption.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer23|Nothing is left, it is too faded to read.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer24|It is growing instructions for the skeleton of a creature, nothing you would understand.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer25|This one contains a numerical sequence encoding all of the registered<LINE>identification numbers for those who dwelled in my city.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer26|Part of a number series. This was likely used as a cipher.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer27|This pearl is filled to capacity, a tremendous feat. However, it only appears to<LINE>contain a single excessively large image, which happens to be completely blank.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer28|Strange, a singular number "8" has been written to this and nothing else.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer29|It is an old blueprint for construction supports.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer30|This is a very early research journal, equating void fluid to antimatter. While that comparison<LINE>works metaphorically, it fundamentally misunderstands the true nature of the fluid.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer31|A maintenance log of a routine inspection of my superstructure. No problems to report.<LINE>After all, I was still brand new when this log was written.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer32|This is incomplete source code for a complex simulation of our world, known as The World Machine.<LINE>However, public ascension concluded long before it could be finished by its author.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer33|It is a drawing by a young child, depicting the likeness of an iterator puppet. Specifically, I presume<LINE>this is meant to represent my puppet, but the drawing is too crude to tell for sure. How awful.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer34|This reads like someone attempting to copy a book from their memory alone.<LINE>Many chapters are only partially written, and some do not exist.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer35|A classical hymn from an early dynasty. It is very short and repetitive,<LINE>but its archiving will please me greatly.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer36|It's a log from a sensor monitoring conditions on the surface. The log ends abruptly<LINE>after some time, as the sensor suffered irreparable damage from the heavy rainfall.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer37|There are 71 numbers listed on this pearl, and they are some of the most unlucky numbers I have ever seen.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer38|"Dear diary..." and then nothing.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer39|A model of a fluid carrying pipe section. The joints are designed to promote self-sealing.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer40|It is a catalog of many types of teas, and their brewing techniques. I do not<LINE>possess the ability to drink tea, so this is of no use to me. You can keep it.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer41|It's the blueprint for a small incense purification filter. An<LINE>understandable necessity before the departure of my creators.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer42|An image of five bottles of water, standing upon a surface of filter feeding plants.<LINE>A reflection of desire for something denied. A painting from the late Red literary<LINE>dynasty by the famed painter Twenty-One Spokes of a Stone Wheel, a true visionary!
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer43|I would prefer not to speak of the contents recorded in this pearl.<LINE>Some things are best left unknown.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer44|Old schematics for a gas filtration machine, very rough and unoptimized.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer45|This pearl contains a series of puzzles designed to exercise the mind. However, I've already<LINE>solved them all in the time it took me to say these sentences aloud to you.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer46|This is a malicious pearl. The data is meaningless, but the way it is formatted would cause older machinery<LINE>to get stuck in an infinite recursion trying to read it. Luckily, I am more sophisticated than that.
it-5p-pearl-WhiteArtificer47|This contains the image of a pearl... and within that the same image. This is either<LINE>a joke, or a method of testing a pearl's recursive density.

it-lttm-MoonReadPebbles11|A memory... but not really visual, or even concrete, in its character. It reminds of<LINE>the feeling of a warm wind, but not the physical feeling but the... inner feeling.<LINE>I don't think it has much utility unless you are doing some very fringe Regeneraist research.

it-lttm-pearl-SU1|Its entire memory is filled with a mantra repeated... 5061 times - and then a termination verse.<LINE>It was worn as an amulet, probably together with many identical others forming a pattern on some garment.
it-lttm-pearl-SU2|The repeating mantra is important because it symbolizes the cyclical nature of life and death, and the<LINE>termination verse is a symbol for ascension above and beyond it.

it-5p-pearl-SUArtificer2|Pearls like these were worn simply as beads, some in sets of hundreds.<LINE>I am sure the scavengers would have more use for this than I would.

it-lttm-pearl-UW1|This one has plain text. Let me cut the lengthy introductions...
it-lttm-pearl-UW1|"...we will not consider the Current Situation acceptable. Although our community is Blessed with an ever<LINE>shrinking Population, and we can Almost Glimpse that Glorious moment when the last of us has joined our<LINE>most Admired peers, we must still (at All Times!) maintain Good Relations with our Iterator.
it-lttm-pearl-UW1|The Moral Argument: Five Pebbles is our Creation, and we have Parental Obligations towards him. As an Iterator,<LINE>he is also a Gift of Charity from Us to The World (unable to reach Enlightenment by itself - being composed mostly<LINE>of Rock, Gas, dull witted Bugs and Microbes - and towards which We thus have Obligations).
it-lttm-pearl-UW1|The Practical Argument: Despite You being family, I must Beg Forgiveness for the<LINE>Blunt Vulgarity - but We are (for as long as we Remain) Dependent on Five Pebbles<LINE>for Water, Nectar, Energy, Void Fluid and All other Vital Resources.<LINE>By Now, living on the surface is Laughable.<LINE>We are Across the River and have Kicked out the Boat.
it-lttm-pearl-UW1|I therefor ask you to Do Anything in your Might to stop the House(We both know which House)<LINE>from Further Obstruction! They have less than forty members on the Council, but still Tilt<LINE>the spiritual Discourse with Our Iterator in a direction that most obviously Displeases him,<LINE>and is hardly High Held by anyone in the Community either! We can not Risk this!"
it-lttm-pearl-UW1|And then there are polite farewells. None of us really miss the times when their cities were populated.<LINE>Imagine having skin parasites that also ask for advice and have opinions...
it-lttm-pearl-UW1|I'm sorry, that was disrespectful. They were our parents after all.

it-5p-pearl-UWArtificer1|This one has not been archived. It was likely transported by hand...
it-5p-pearl-UWArtificer2|It is a message of political discourse regarding concerns about the increasingly<LINE>tense relationship between myself and the various Houses. This part is amusing.
it-5p-pearl-UWArtificer3|"I therefor ask you to Do Anything in your Might to stop the House(We both know which House)<LINE>from Further Obstruction! They have less than forty members on the Council, but still Tilt<LINE>the spiritual Discourse with Our Iterator in a direction that most obviously Displeases him,<LINE>and is hardly High Held by anyone in the Community either! We can not Risk this!"
it-5p-pearl-UWArtificer4|It is no secret that my construction was a point of great controversy. Many council members worked vehemently<LINE>to prevent me from ever coming into being. Their stance was so unfaltering that even after construction was<LINE>complete, a number of Houses still denied transfer and remained behind in her city out of protest.
it-5p-pearl-UWArtificer5|This rift caused frequent feuds and tensions amongst the community. Those of the opposition<LINE>would never yield to those who supported the so called "Apostate Superstructure Abomination".<LINE>But to say I found their actions displeasing? Not quite.
it-5p-pearl-UWArtificer6|While certainly more violent and disruptive, they at least provided me interesting cognitive<LINE>challenges to use my time on. As opposed to the endless rituals and pleasantries of the monks<LINE>of my own Houses, which I found to be the most wearisome of all.
it-5p-pearl-UWArtificer7|None of this matters any more. The only displeasing presence I have now is you.
it-5p-pearl-UWArtificer8|Allow me to get back to my work.

it-lttm-pearl-SB1|It's a conversation log, all plain text. You want me to read it?
it-lttm-pearl-SB2|"1681.662 - PRIVATE<LINE>Seven Red Suns, Chasing Wind
it-lttm-pearl-SB3|CW: Have you had any contact with Five Pebbles recently?
it-lttm-pearl-B4|SRS: Not in a long while actually! Unless worrying about him counts.
it-lttm-pearl-SB5|CW: One of his neighbors, Unparalleled Innocence, sent an overseer to his can and got some images.<LINE>They were made public in the local group, in an effort to be mean I suppose.<LINE>There's no other way of putting it - he looks awful.
it-lttm-pearl-SB6|SRS: Tell me.
it-lttm-pearl-SB7|CW: He's got the rot, very badly. Big cysts have become mobile and are scattering down the west and middle legs.<LINE>He does listen to you, and few others by now, so you should talk to him.
it-lttm-pearl-SB8|SRS: I will try to contact him. Does Moon know?
it-lttm-pearl-SB9|CW: Moon has been unavailable for some time."

it-lttm-ScavBomb|It's a lot of flammable powder stuffed into some kind of shell. I would be very careful around this!

it-lttm-NeuronMisc1|After all this time, a lifeline. Thank you.
it-lttm-NeuronMisc2|I'll never feel the power I once had, but this is something to sustain an old soul.
it-lttm-NeuronMisc3|I could read a bit of Five Pebbles in this neuron before formatting it.<LINE>A ghost left from his processing routines.
it-lttm-NeuronMisc4|Erratic... Pulse. "Erratic Pulse." I wonder what that means.

it-5p-HunterNeuron1|Let us see what you have here.
it-5p-HunterNeuron2|50 : 0 : Eleven... no sixteen! Sixteen slag reset keys.
it-5p-HunterNeuron3|I've seen several before, but one or two will be useful.
it-5p-HunterNeuron4|However, it seems this delivery was not intended for me. Everything suggests<LINE>it was tailored for the specific predicaments of a friend of mine.
it-5p-HunterNeuron5|Her name is Looks to the Moon, and her state is considerably worse than mine.<LINE>She's a short distance to the east of here - much shorter than customary.<LINE>A circumstance that has led to some difficulties between us.

it-5p-HunterNoNeuron1|I barely listen to the overseers any more. I have concluded that the movements of<LINE>animals on the premises absolutely and completely lack relevance to my endeavours.
it-5p-HunterNoNeuron2|With you, they have been very persistent ever since you entered my Farm Arrays. You were on an unusually deliberate path.
it-5p-HunterNoNeuron3|0 : 15 : Now you are here.
it-5p-HunterNoNeuron4|The images showed you carrying something. You are not any longer.
it-5p-HunterNoNeuron5|Did you lose it along the way? Or did you give it to Looks to the Moon?
it-5p-HunterNoNeuron6|In the latter case, I hope it was of some help to her. Not that I can imagine what one<LINE>of you could be able to do for one of us, but she needs all the help she can get.
it-5p-HunterNoNeuron7|15 : 20 : ...
it-5p-HunterNoNeuron8|You seem to have been in contact with an iterator before, so perhaps you are already aware.
it-5p-HunterNoNeuron9|You and I have something in common, little creature. We both have something... unfortunate growing in us.
it-5p-HunterNoNeuron10|In my case, there is not much to be done. For you however, there might be a way. The old path.
it-5p-HunterNoNeuron11|Go to the west past the Farm Arrays, and then down into the earth where the land fissures, as deep as you can reach,<LINE>where the ancients built their temples and danced their silly rituals.
it-5p-HunterNoNeuron12|I will give you something that might be of help.
it-5p-HunterNoNeuron13|10 : 30 : I suggest you hurry.

it-5p-Monk1|I am growing increasingly impatient with the traffic of your kind through me and my premises.
it-5p-Monk2|During previous interactions, I have been rewarded no other response than a blank stare. Yet you apparently have<LINE>sufficient ability for communication to circulate complex instructions on how to enter this chamber among each other.
it-5p-Monk3|You and your kind have the same problem as everyone else, from the microbes in the processing strata<LINE>to me, who am, if you excuse me, godlike in comparison. We all want a way out. It is only unfortunate<LINE>that you have collectively decided on... me as your solution to that very elemental desire.
it-5p-Monk4|The last one I gave some help and some general directions. I will do the same for you.
it-5p-Monk5|Go west. Past the Farm Arrays. Where the land fissures, go down into the earth and search your way deeper.
it-5p-Monk6|Now in return I ask you to use whatever grunts, moans and eye-twitches you employ to forward a message to your community.
it-5p-Monk7|10 : 25 : Please stop scratching your way through my memory arrays.
it-5p-Monk8|Speaking of, on your way out please use the access shaft.

it-lttm-Monk1|Hello little creature.
it-lttm-Monk2|Your shape is familiar to me. I feel as if I... might have met your kind before.
it-lttm-Monk3|30 : 0 : But my memory is so unreliable now.
it-lttm-Monk4|I see that someone has given you the gift of communication.<LINE>Must have been Five Pebbles, as you don't look like you can travel very far...
it-lttm-Monk5|He's sick, you know. Being corrupted from the inside by his own experiments. Maybe they all are by now, who knows.<LINE>We weren't designed to transcend and it drives us mad.
it-lttm-Monk6|0 : 30 : Hm...
it-lttm-Monk7|Such a familiar feeling.

it-lttm-Hunter1|He... hello
it-lttm-Hunter2|90 : 20 : Hello little... creature. You... you did this?
it-lttm-Hunter3|One moment. My memory isn't responding. I... I have no idea...
it-lttm-Hunter4|...must have been gone for...
it-lttm-Hunter5|0 : 40 : ...
it-lttm-Hunter6|40 : 0 : Oh.
it-lttm-Hunter7|Little creature...
it-lttm-Hunter8|You are not well.
it-lttm-Hunter9|I am so sorry to say, but you do not have much time left.
it-lttm-Hunter10|If things are as they seem... thank you
it-lttm-Hunter11|I don't know why you spent your... last... remaining cycles helping me. But know that I<LINE>am deeply grateful. I have known very few beings who could aspire to such a noble thing.<LINE>You really are... an amazing little creature.
it-lttm-Hunter12|10 : 20 : I wish I could say I will always remember it.
it-lttm-Hunter13|0 : 40 : ...
it-lttm-Hunter14|20 : 0 : Little friend. Perhaps you already know this, and I don't know what consolation it might bring, but...
it-lttm-Hunter15|40 : 0 : You will wake right back up again.

it-lttm-pearl-Hunter1|"Triple affirmative! Triple affirmative!
it-lttm-pearl-HunterPearl2|10 : 0 : In all seriousness though, noticed barely any rain from<LINE>your can so figured a little support might be in order.
it-lttm-pearl-HunterPearl3|Wasn't that easy to see of course, with Pebbles' shall we say healthy output.
it-lttm-pearl-HunterPearl4|Enjoy the slag keys! Excuse the unorthodox delivery method, equipment eroding etc etc.
it-lttm-pearl-HunterPearl5|0 : 30 : Be well, NSH"
it-lttm-pearl-HunterPearl6|40 : 10 : Oh.
it-lttm-pearl-HunterPearl7|0 : 20 : I see now. Again, thank you little friend.

it-lttm-OverseerEye1|It is the remains of an overseer.
it-lttm-OverseerEye2|20 : 20 : Overseers act as our eyes on the outside.
it-lttm-OverseerEye3|I used to have a lot of them, but I lost contact with them when I was neutered. My umbilical is cut.<LINE>So, since then I am not much more than what you are looking at - a little creature in a box.
it-lttm-OverseerEye4|I suspect by now all my overseers are gone out there. Without me they would just roam around with no purpose.
it-lttm-OverseerEye5|The scavengers tend to hunt them, it's one of their very few ways of expressing defiance.
it-lttm-OverseerEye6|20 : 30 : It's of course not completely impossible that there are a few left. Say hello if you see one.

it-lttm-BubbleGrass1|It's a plant that keeps pressurised air in these globules.
it-lttm-BubbleGrass2|I'm not very familiar with contemporary flora, so I can't tell you much more.

it-lttm-pearl-SLTower1|It is the genome for a purposed organism.<LINE>A small slug to clean the insides of pipes.
it-lttm-pearl-SLTower2|Do you know what a purposed organism is? Actually you are talking to one right now!
it-lttm-pearl-SLTower3|Although, a small fraction of one. Nowadays I am mostly just my puppet. The bulk of me is in these walls but I am<LINE>disconnected from those parts, to a degree where I am only vaguely aware of how bad their condition is.
it-lttm-pearl-SLTower4|Most purposed organisms were considerably smaller than me, and most barely looked like organisms at all.<LINE>More like tubes in metal boxes, where something went in one end and something else came out the other.
it-lttm-pearl-SLTower5|There were of course those that were purposed for spectacle rather than industry - they enjoyed the privilege of glass boxes.
it-lttm-pearl-SLTower6|When I came into this world there was very little primal fauna left.<LINE>So it's highly likely that you are the descendant of a purposed organism yourself!

SLTowerPearlArtificer1|This is a genome for a purposed organism. Just a menial cleaning slug.
SLTowerPearlArtificer2|While I do not have this exact sequence on record, the simple structures present,<LINE>and lack of mechanical interchange glands, mean this blueprint is quite old.
SLTowerPearlArtificer3|This creature would be much closer to a domesticated animal, compared to the newer<LINE>and specialized organisms produced with more modern techniques. A being made to<LINE>live its life inside a metal pipe deep underground has no need for eyes after all.
SLTowerPearlArtificer4|In the same way, my own body is all around you. Composed of specialized organisms,<LINE>and machinery. What you see in front of you is only the tiny extremity of a<LINE>colossal presence. One that your simple mind could not hope to comprehend.

it-lttm-pearl-SLTowerSpear1|It is the genome for a purposed organism.<LINE>A small slug to clean the insides of pipes.
it-lttm-pearl-SLTowerSpear2|Do you know what a purposed organism is? Actually you are talking to one right now!
it-lttm-pearl-SLTowerSpear3|Most purposed organisms were considerably smaller than me, and most barely looked like organisms at all.<LINE>More like tubes in metal boxes, where something went in one end and something else came out the other.
it-lttm-pearl-SLTowerSpear4|There were of course those that were purposed for spectacle rather than industry - they enjoyed the privilege of glass boxes.
it-lttm-pearl-SLTowerSpear5|When I came into this world there was very little primal fauna left.<LINE>You are certainly a purposed organism yourself!
it-lttm-pearl-SLTowerSpear6|So then, what purpose do you serve, <PLAYERNAME>? For many, that's<LINE>a question that can take a lifetime to find an answer to.

it-lttm-HunterTwo1|Hi! Little saviour!
it-lttm-HunterTwo2|It is good to see you again.
it-lttm-HunterTwo3|I wish I could help you like you have helped me... But like this, there is very little I can do.
it-lttm-HunterTwo4|All I can do is express how thankful I am. You have given me<LINE>some additional time... despite not having a lot of it yourself.
it-lttm-HunterTwo5|30 : 0 : I hope... this was meaningful for you.
it-lttm-HunterTwo6|20 : 40 : It was for me.

it-5p-HealHunter1|I am not without responsibility for her situation. It would only be suiting that I aided in this... rescue mission.<LINE>As other endeavors have proven futile, I'm not ashamed to admit I've become more invested in day to day matters.
it-5p-HealHunter1|I will do what I can to assist you.
it-5p-HealHunter1|Unless you are aware, you are not well.
it-5p-HealHunter1|I was not a medical facility even when the equipment was functioning,<LINE>but I will attempt to do something to buy you a little time.

it-5p-HunterNeuronTwo|You do not have much time. It is admirable what you choose to do with it.
it-5p-HunterNeuronTwo|30 : 30 : Send my regards.

it-5p-MeetSurv1|. . .
it-5p-MeetSurv2|...is this reaching you?
it-5p-MeetSurv3|A little animal, on the floor of my chamber. I think I know what you are looking for.
it-5p-MeetSurv4|You're stuck in a cycle, a repeating pattern. You want a way out.
it-5p-MeetSurv5|Know that this does not make you special - every living thing shares that same frustration. From the microbes in the processing strata to me, who am, if you excuse me, godlike in comparison.
it-5p-MeetSurv6|The good news first. In a way, I am what you are searching for. Me and my kind have as our purpose to solve that very oscillating claustrophobia in the chests of you and countless others. A strange charity - you the unknowing recipient, I the reluctant gift. The noble benefactors? Gone.
it-5p-MeetSurv7|The bad news is that no definitive solution has been found. And every moment the equipment erodes to a new state of decay. I can't help you collectively, or individually. I can't even help myself.
it-5p-MeetSurv8|For you though, there is another way. The old path. Go to the west past the Farm Arrays, and then down into the earth where the land fissures, as deep as you can reach, where the ancients built their temples and danced their silly rituals. The mark I gave you will let you through.
it-5p-MeetSurv9|Not that it solves anyone's problem but yours.

it-5p-TravelFromGSB|At the end of time none of this will matter I suppose, but it would be nice if you took another way out. One free of... frolicking in my memory arrays. There is a perfectly good access shaft right here.

it-5p-TravelFromWall|Best of luck to you, little creature. I must resume my work.

it-5p-Linger1|That's all. You'll have to go now.
it-5p-Linger2|LEAVE.
it-5p-Linger3|Little creature. This is your last warning.

it-5p-Return1|You again? I have nothing for you.
it-5p-Return2|I won't tolerate this. Leave immediately and don't come back.
it-5p-Return3|You had your chances.

it-5p-PearlGrab|Yes, help yourself. They are not edible.

it-5p-Creature1|Best of luck to you, and your companion. There is nothing else I can do.
it-5p-Creature2|I must resume my work.

it-5p-CreatureSlugpup1|Best of luck to you, and your family. There is nothing else I can do.
it-5p-CreatureSlugpup2|I must resume my work.
