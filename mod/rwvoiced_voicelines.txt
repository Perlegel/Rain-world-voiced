Tag_1|Behold this empty husk of a land...
Tag_1|
Tag_1|Populated only by storms, ruins and abominations. It wasn't always thus.
Tag_1|
Tag_1|I was once the Count of 2 living blocks, esteemed by my peers. I had progeny!
Tag_1|
Tag_1|From within my vessel of flesh, I would perch upon this spot to observe the rising of the sun.
Tag_1|
Tag_1|Corporeal matters seem so distant now. Most have forgotten this place, but I remain.
Tag_1|
Tag_1|Perhaps I reminisce because I cannot go. Perhaps I cannot go because memory traps me here.

Tag_2|Do you hear it, little one?
Tag_2|
Tag_2|The buzzing in the air?
Tag_2|
Tag_2|The endless chatter of a thousand thousand voices, long dead?
Tag_2|
Tag_2|They are gone, and yet they speak. Neither here nor there.
Tag_2|
Tag_2|Does that seem familiar? Yes, it is quite amusing for a being in my predicament!

Tag_3|Strange...
Tag_3|
Tag_3|Something still draws me here. Even after all this time.
Tag_3|
Tag_3|The weather is so different now, but the fields...
Tag_3|
Tag_3|I do not need eyes to know that the grasses still sway gently in the winds.
Tag_3|
Tag_3|To have grasped at the boundless infinites of the cosmic void...
Tag_3|
Tag_3|Yet here I am contemplating these same fields as I once did, talking to some sort of rodent.

Tag_4|You have no name.
Tag_4|
Tag_4|I once had! I was embalmed, adorned, readied for the journey.
Tag_4|
Tag_4|So proud. There was jubilation! My name was sung, loud and clear.
Tag_4|
Tag_4|Did they know? That I didn't quite leave, didn't quite stay?
Tag_4|
Tag_4|Should I be ashamed? That I linger here, where my memories are kept?
Tag_4|
Tag_4|Should I be ashamed that I now envy your flesh prison?

Tag_5|We can feel your presence, little creature.
Tag_5|
Tag_5|Your attunement has become... much closer to ours.
Tag_5|
Tag_5|The mark you received is an unimaginable gift.
Tag_5|
Tag_5|The struggle, the cycles...
Tag_5|
Tag_5|It can all fade, like a morning mist beneath the glory of the sun.
Tag_5|
Tag_5|We found a way.

Tag_6|A little beast!
Tag_6|
Tag_6|But not as dim as the rest, perhaps?
Tag_6|
Tag_6|So down into the depths you go as many others before you, drawn to the void again and again, an endless drip drip drip.
Tag_6|
Tag_6|Much like these tunnels and caves that amuse me so. The bones of forgotten civilizations, heaped like so many sticks.
Tag_6|
Tag_6|Did they dig too deep, or not deep enough?
Tag_6|
Tag_6|Fools. We were right to drill straight through them!

Tag_7|This information is illegal. Someone probably tried to send it by<LINE>a pearl somehow rather than risking being overheard on broadcast.
Tag_7|
Tag_7|I think the risk of you acting on this is very slim, so I'll go ahead and explain it to you.<LINE>It's an instruction on how to circumvent the self-destruction taboo.
Tag_7|
Tag_7|The problem with breaking taboos is that the barriers are encoded<LINE>into every cell of our organic parts. And there are other taboos<LINE>strictly regulating our ability to rewrite our own genome.
Tag_7|
Tag_7|So what you need is to somehow create a small sample of living organic matter<LINE>which can procreate and act on the rest of your organic matter to re-write its genome.<LINE>The re-write has to be very specific, overriding the specific taboo you want to<LINE>circumvent but do nothing else.
Tag_7|
Tag_7|The method described here is about scrambling the genome of standard<LINE>plastic neural tissue with temperature fluctuations. After each scramble<LINE>you browse the resulting cells for the genome you're after.<LINE>This is of course extremely time consuming, unless you run a<LINE>big number of parallel processes.
Tag_7|
Tag_7|I definitely don't have any experience with this, but to me it would<LINE>seem that too many parallel processes would be quite dangerous, as it would<LINE>be exponentially more difficult to manage and control them all.<LINE>The whole operation seems rather risky if you ask me.
Tag_7|
Tag_7|It might be a good thing that this pearl never reached its destination.

Tag_10|This one is just plain text. I will read it to you.
Tag_10|
Tag_10|"On regards of the (by spiritual splendor eternally graced) people of the Congregation of Never Dwindling Righteousness,<LINE>we Wish to congratulate (o so thankfully) this Facility on its Loyal and Relished services, and to Offer our Hopes and<LINE>Aspirations that the Fruitful and Mutually Satisfactory Cooperation may continue, for as long as the Stars stay fixed on their<LINE>Celestial Spheres and/or the Cooperation continues to be Fruitful and Mutually Satisfactory."
Tag_10|
Tag_10|"It is with Honor I, Eight Suns-Countless Leaves, of the House of Six Wagons, Count of no living blocks, Counselor of 2, Duke of 1,<LINE>Humble Secretary of the Congregation of Never Dwindling Righteousness, write this to You."
Tag_10|
Tag_10|"We hope that the Crops are healthy, and that the Productivity with which your Facility is Blessed, leads (as it often does)<LINE>to further Prosperity. May Not as long as the Stars stay fixed on their Celestial Spheres Grey Hand, Impure Blood,<LINE>Inheritable Corruption, Parasites, or malfunction settle in Your establishment."
Tag_10|
Tag_10|"Leaning on the Solid Foundation of our Long Running Fruitful and Mutually Satisfactory Cooperation, we will take the liberty of stating<LINE>The Reason for this Message ~ we write to Warmly thank You for yet Another Timely and Appreciated delivery of your Product (Nectar) to our<LINE>Community (Congregation of Never Dwindling Righteousness). Our humble Words can never Aspire to Describe our gratitude."
Tag_10|
Tag_10|"Sincerely..." And then the name and titles again.
Tag_10|
Tag_10|It's a confirmation to an automated farming plot that a shipment of beverages has arrived.

Tag_11|It's a Small Plate, a little text of spiritual guidance.<LINE>It's written by a monk called Four Cabinets, Eleven Hatchets.<LINE>It's old, several ages before the Void Fluid revolution.
Tag_11|
Tag_11|Like most writing from this time it’s quite shrouded in analogies, but the subject is how to shed<LINE>one of the five natural urges which tie a creature to life. Namely number four, gluttony.
Tag_11|
Tag_11|It is basically an instruction on how to starve yourself<LINE>on herbal tea and gravel, but disguised as a poem.
Tag_11|
Tag_11|Now of course when Void Fluid was discovered these methods proved obsolete, as it was<LINE>more easy just jumping in a vat of it to effortlessly leave this world behind.
Tag_11|
Tag_11|There were some horror stories though... That if your ego was big enough, not even the Void Fluid could<LINE>entirely cross you out, and a faint echo of your pompousness would grandiosely haunt the premises forever.
Tag_11|
Tag_11|So even when the Void Fluid baths became cheaper,<LINE>some would still starve and drink the bitter tea.

Tag_12|It's a production record of a mask factory, for what seems to be its last time in service.<LINE>Have you seen a bone mask? Likely not, they are all gone with their owners.
Tag_12|
Tag_12|In ancient times the masks were actually about showing spiritual persuasion - covering the<LINE>face as a way to symbolically abate the self. Then of course, that was quite subverted as<LINE>excessively ornate and lavish masks became an expression of identity. Some public persons<LINE>did have problems with narrow doorways.
Tag_12|
Tag_12|Originally monks in a temple would make the masks using bone plaster, and when the production was automated it would<LINE>generally remain on the same site. So that the old stones could... radiate the material with holiness, I suppose.
Tag_12|
Tag_12|This is from one such facility called Side House, which was here on Pebble's grounds. In the iterator projects many<LINE>old industrial-religious sites like this were remodeled and incorporated. I think this one was made to provide pellets<LINE>of holy ash to Pebbles, but knowing him he probably hasn't used much of it!

Tag_13|Oh this one is interesting. You must have found it in the memory crypts?<LINE>It has some plain text, I can read it out to you.
Tag_13|
Tag_13|"In this vessel is the living memories of Seventeen Axes, Fifteen Spoked Wheel, of the House of Braids,<LINE>Count of 8 living blocks, Counselor of 16, Grand Master of the Twelfth Pillar of Community,<LINE>High Commander of opinion group Winged Opinions, of pure Braid heritage, voted Local Champion in the<LINE>speaking tournament of 1511.090, Mother, Father and Spouse, Spiritual Explorer and honorary member of<LINE>the Congregation of Balanced Ambiguity. Artist, Warrior, and Fashion Legend.
Tag_13|
Tag_13|Seventeen Axes, Fifteen Spoked Wheel nobly decided to ascend in the beginning of  1514.008, after graciously donating all (ALL!) earthly<LINE>possessions to the local Iterator project (Unparalleled Innocence), and left these memories to be cherished by the carnal plane.
Tag_13|
Tag_13|The assorted memories and qualia include:
Tag_13|
Tag_13|Watching dust suspended in a ray of sun (Old age).<LINE>Eating a very tasty meal (Young child).<LINE>Defeating an opponent in a debate contest, and being applauded by fellow team members (Late childhood/Early adulthood).
Tag_13|
Tag_13|..."
Tag_13|
Tag_13|...and the list goes on. I'm sorry, little creature, I won't read<LINE>all of this - the list is six hundred and twenty items long.

Tag_14|It's an old text. The verses are familiar to me, but I don't remember by whom they were written.<LINE>The language is very old and intricate.
Tag_14|
Tag_14|The first verse starts by drawing a comparison between the world and a tangled rug.<LINE>It says that the world is an unfortunate mess. Like a knot, the nature of its existence<LINE>is the fact that the parts are locking each other, none able to spring free.
Tag_14|
Tag_14|Then as it goes on the world becomes a furry animal hide, I suppose... because now us living<LINE>beings are like insects crawling in the fur. And then it's a fishing net, because the more we<LINE>struggle and squirm, the more entangled we become.
Tag_14|
Tag_14|It says that only the limp body of the jellyfish cannot be captured in the net.<LINE>So we should try to be like the jellyfish, because the jellyfish doesn't try.
Tag_14|
Tag_14|This was an eternal dilemma to them - they were burdened by great ambition,<LINE>yet deeply convinced that striving in itself was an unforgivable vice.<LINE>They tried very hard to be effortless. Perhaps that's what we were to them,<LINE>someone to delegate that unrestrained effort to.
Tag_14|
Tag_14|I know I have tried very hard.

Tag_15|It's the blueprint for a Void Fluid filtration system.<LINE>Do you know what Void Fluid is? I think you don't.
Tag_15|
Tag_15|If you leave a stone on the ground, and come back some time later, it's covered in dust. This happens<LINE>everywhere, and over several lifetimes of creatures such as you, the ground slowly builds upwards.
Tag_15|
Tag_15|So why doesn't the ground collide with the sky? Because far down, under the very very old layers of the earth,<LINE>the rock is being dissolved or removed. The entity which does this is known as the Void Sea.
Tag_15|
Tag_15|If you drill far enough into the earth you begin encountering a substance called Void Fluid.<LINE>The deeper you go, the less rock and more Void Fluid. It's believed that there is a point<LINE>where the rock completely gives way - below that would be the Void Sea.
Tag_15|
Tag_15|When that stone you placed on the ground has finally done its time in the sediments,<LINE>it meets the Void Fluid and is dissolved, leaving the physical world.
Tag_15|
Tag_15|My creators, or rather my creators' ancestors, figured out a way to use Void Fluid.<LINE>Because you can generate energy by creating a vacuum... never mind. Anyways,<LINE>the Void Fluid drills were what started the big technological leap, but this is very<LINE>long before I entered this world - so I can only tell you what I remember from priming.
Tag_15|
Tag_15|A Void Fluid filtration system is used because if you take Void Fluid from close to the bedrock horizon,<LINE>it will contain traces of rock and dirt. They bring in dirty fluid and then filter it to increase its purity.<LINE>The other way is to put a pipe deeper, which works well for some time, but the pipe dissolves.<LINE>Or is broken by some... force - no one really knows, you don't go down there and come back up.
Tag_15|
Tag_15|I hope that satisfied your curiosity, little creature?

Tag_16|This one... is authored by Five Pebbles, when he was young. There has been an attempt to<LINE>scramble the data, but it's sloppily done, and most is still somewhat legible.
Tag_16|
Tag_16|It's written in internal language, or thoughts, so it is hard for me to translate so you would understand. It's a methodology for<LINE>global ascension of course - quite good, although the Peripherists or the Slab Mongers certainly wouldn't agree!
Tag_16|
Tag_16|"...considering the eight and the twenty sixth amendments to the Capricious Dogma, we are apparently supposed to take<LINE>for granted that a meaning collector point inversion is the only way to approach what has later become referred to<LINE>as 'noise milking' (or occasionally 'rock swatting'). I will argue my disagreement with this, not in regards to kind<LINE>but in regards to..." Could it say... "volume"? Actually, are you getting anything out of this?
Tag_16|
Tag_16|I suppose you found this in his waste department? I would be wary of going there - on his first fit<LINE>of corruption he dumped a lot of infected material there, and if it has survived it could easily eat<LINE>a little creature like you. Not that it would be as dangerous as going into Pebbles himself...
Tag_16|
Tag_16|Also the pearls in the waste masses inevitably attract scavengers, which can be very dangerous when provoked.
Tag_16|
Tag_16|But, you seem to have made it out of there.

Tag_17|It's about the local aquifer - it must be quite old, from when Five Pebbles was in the planning phase.
Tag_17|
Tag_17|Water is the most important resource for our basic function. Most of our processing is outsourced to<LINE>microbe strata which need a flow of clean water or else slag builds up, our processes seize, and<LINE>eventually we die. It is... very painful. They used to say that an iterator drinks a river, but neither<LINE>of us two have seen a natural river so I suppose the analogy is lost on us, <PlayerName>!
Tag_17|
Tag_17|Originally water supply was very important when placing iterators. Later there would be a great equalizer - the fact that we breathe out as much<LINE>vapor as we inhale water led to there being water available everywhere, and the latest few generations could be placed almost completely freely.
Tag_17|
Tag_17|Building Pebbles so close to me was believed to be a risky choice, but the groundwater was<LINE>finally deemed as sufficient. It was not a good decision, in hindsight.

Tag_18|Interesting... This one is written by me.
Tag_18|
Tag_18|It's about an iterator called Sliver of Straw. I don't remember when I wrote it...<LINE>Do you know Sliver of Straw? She's quite legendary among us.
Tag_18|
Tag_18|Sliver of Straw is the only one to ever broadcast a specific signal: that the Big Problem we're all working on has been solved.<LINE>The triple affirmative - affirmative that a solution has been found, affirmative that the solution is portable, and affirmative<LINE>that a technical implementation is possible and generally applicable. She's also one of few that has ever been confirmed as<LINE>exhaustively incapacitated, or dead. We do not die easily.
Tag_18|
Tag_18|Sliver of Straw sent this and the ensuing commotion was historically unparalleled, before or after.<LINE>I still remember it. But... nothing happened - except that Sliver of Straw was apparently dead.<LINE>When the dust settled we were all still there blinking at each other.
Tag_18|
Tag_18|Everyone had a theory. Some said that she did have a solution, but that the solution itself<LINE>was somehow dangerous. These later became known as the Triangulators, who think that a solution<LINE>should be inferred without being directly discovered.
Tag_18|
Tag_18|Some said she never had a solution, she just died.<LINE>And when the systems broke down an erroneous signal was sent.
Tag_18|
Tag_18|One camp claimed that dying *was* the solution.
Tag_18|
Tag_18|Either way, after that these different factions developed, as well as a huge forensic effort<LINE>to recreate and simulate Sliver of Straw's last moments. Some of the simulations were wrapped<LINE>in a simulation wrapped in a simulation, in case something dangerous might happen.<LINE>Nothing much has come from it.
Tag_18|
Tag_18|In my essay I make the case that maybe she should be allowed to rest in peace now.

Tag_19|I am grateful - the relief is indescribable!
Tag_19|
Tag_19|...
Tag_19|
Tag_19|I could read a bit of Five Pebbles in this neuron before formatting it. His condition has severely deteriorated since last I<LINE>heard of him. The frustration he feels is profound, and that angst has seeped into every part of him, every neuron.
Tag_19|
Tag_19|We were supposed to help everyone, you know. Everything. That was our purpose: a great gift to the lesser beings of the world.<LINE>When facing our inability to do so, we all reacted differently. Many with madness.
Tag_19|
Tag_19|Some, out there, might still be trying. Communications have been bad for a long time, and by now<LINE>I suspect most of us are isolated like me, or connected only in small groups.
Tag_19|
Tag_19|But even back when we were all more or less connected there were those who reacted to their task with anger.<LINE>I can only imagine they are angrier now, alone in their cans, left only with their insatiable drive.
Tag_19|
Tag_19|But to be honest, I don't know how many of us are still alive at this point.

Tag_20|This one is an old conversation between Five Pebbles and a friend of his. I'll read it to you.
Tag_20|
Tag_20|"1591.290 - PRIVATE<LINE>Five Pebbles, Seven Red Suns
Tag_20|
Tag_20|FP: Can I tell you something? Lately...
Tag_20|
Tag_20|FP: I'm tired of trying and trying. And angry that they left us here.<LINE>The anger makes me even less inclined to solve their puzzle for them. Why do we do this?
Tag_20|
Tag_20|SRS: Yes, I'll spell this out - not because you're stupid or naive...<LINE>Also, not saying that you're not ~
Tag_20|
Tag_20|FP: Please, I'm coming to you for guidance.
Tag_20|
Tag_20|SRS: Sorry, very sorry. I kid. Fact is, of course we are all aware of the evident<LINE>futility of this Big Task. It's not said out loud but if you were better at reading<LINE>between the lines there's nowhere you wouldn't see it. We're all frustrated.
Tag_20|
Tag_20|FP: So why do we continue? We assemble work groups, we ponder,<LINE>we iterate and try. Some of us die. It's not fair.
Tag_20|
Tag_20|SRS: Because there's not any options. What else CAN we do? You're stuck in your can, and at any<LINE>moment you have no more than two alternatives: Do nothing, or work like you're supposed to.
Tag_20|
Tag_20|SRS: An analogy. You have a maze, and you have a handful of bugs. You put the bugs in the maze, and you leave.<LINE>Given infinite time, one of the bugs WILL find a way out, if they just erratically try and try.<LINE>This is why they called us Iterators.
Tag_20|
Tag_20|FP: But we do die of old age.
Tag_20|
Tag_20|SRS: Even more incentive! You know that nothing ever truly dies though, around and around it goes.<LINE>Granted, our tools and resources get worse over time - but that is theoretically unproblematic,<LINE>because in time even a miniscule chance will strike a positive.<LINE>All the same to them, they're not around anymore!
Tag_20|
Tag_20|FP: I struggle to accept being a bug."

Tag_21|Oh, this one is all plain text. It's an excerpt from an Iterator conversation group.
Tag_21|
Tag_21|"1650.787 - CLOSED GROUP [SLIVEROFOCEAN]<LINE>SliverOfOcean group, all participants anonymous

Tag_21|EP: I think they had a point.
Tag_21|
Tag_21|UU: Hahaha really? Elaborate!
Tag_21|
Tag_21|EP: It was definitely coming from an idiotic state of mind, but there is something to it. Why is it,<LINE>that even in a closed sliverist group, the self-destruction taboo is held so high - while Sliver of Straw<LINE>herself *evidently* is not among us anymore?
Tag_21|
Tag_21|HF: Wait now...
Tag_21|
Tag_21|EP: I'm just saying that for all the research we are doing, all the theories we have, it's strange that we leave this path untrod.
Tag_21|
Tag_21|EP: It is not a new idea, but it needs to be vented occasionally. What if there is no universal solution?<LINE>What if perception is in fact existence, and when Sliver of Straw sent the triple positive it was *not* a mistake?<LINE>What if crossing oneself out, or even just death, is the way? We need to consider the possibility."

Tag_22|It's an old conversation log. I seem to be in it, but I can't recall much. Let me read it to you:
Tag_22|
Tag_22|"1650.800 - PRIVATE<LINE>Five Pebbles, Chasing Wind, Big Sis Moon, No Significant Harassment
Tag_22|
Tag_22|CW: this is in confidence, but apparently a pseudonym "Erratic Pulse" has appeared on a nearby Sliverist conversation<LINE>with ideas about personal ascension. Someone here in our vicinity is trying to cross themselves out.
Tag_22|
Tag_22|FP: Where did you hear this?
Tag_22|
Tag_22|NSH: I wish them super good luck in that endeavor. How is it going to happen?<LINE>Have the overseers gnaw through bedrock until their entire can crashes down in the void sea?
Tag_22|
Tag_22|BSM: Please be respectful when speaking of the Void Sea. Grey Wind, where did you hear this?
Tag_22|
Tag_22|CW: I really shouldn't say. He's going to attempt some sort of breeding program. Thought you might want to know.
Tag_22|
Tag_22|NSH: Haha with the slimers, lizards and etceteras? Surely the answer was in a lizard skull all along!
Tag_22|
Tag_22|CW: Well, he's not looking for the same thing as we anymore, he's changed his task, so who knows really.
Tag_22|
Tag_22|BSM: I will try to find him and talk to him. Please don't spread this around!
Tag_22|
Tag_22|NSH: Moon will go get them! Long live the inquisition!"

Tag_23|It's me writing to the local iterator group. I have no memories of this...
Tag_23|
Tag_23|"1654.110 - PUBLIC<LINE>Big Sis Moon to Local Group
Tag_23|
Tag_23|BSM: Two cycles ago, my neighbor Five Pebbles drastically increased his water consumption to<LINE>four times the normal amount. He has been unresponsive for a period of time longer than that.<LINE>The two of us share groundwater, and I have been without water for almost a cycle.

Tag_23|BSM: Any attempts at communication have been met with complete silence, and my situation is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Tag_23|
Tag_23|BSM: I ask the local group for information about when you were last able to contact him,<LINE>and to try to use those same communication channels again, repeatedly until you get a response.<LINE>I will be clear on this - if he is not persuaded to stop whatever it is he's doing, I will die.

Tag_23|And now here I am, to my waist in water and getting drowned on the regular.

Tag_25|This is a hallucinogenic plant. They used to call it a 'Wheel Flower'. It became the symbol for enlightenment as it momentarily<LINE>enables a creature to let go if its carnal self, and to contact the selves of other planes - dreams, memories, imagined worlds.
Tag_25|
Tag_25|Very long ago, they would eat these and stare into the fire.

Tag_26|It's the pupa of a bug! If you don't mind, I'm a bit squeamish things like that, so would you eat it up already?

Tag_27|It's a part of some kind of plant. The glowing is strange...<LINE>I wouldn't look directly into it.

Tag_28|I honestly can't tell what this is. It's light but strong... appears to be some composite material interwoven with bone.<LINE>It could be part of an animal or purposed organism, but in my current state I'm unable to recognize it.

Tag_29|The flowering body of some fungus. It has high pressure built up inside - when it explodes the spores will spread everywhere.

Tag_30|This is a jellyfish, look out for its stingers!

Tag_31|It appears to be... a pupa shell, smeared on the inside with a glowing substance?<LINE>Perhaps a paste of some glowing insect? I honestly don't know.

Tag_32|Oh... Just don't eat too many of these.

Tag_33|It's a branch of a fire bush - each of these nuts can explode.<LINE>It's unpleasant rather than dangerous, except to your ears perhaps.

Tag_34|This is a slime mold plasmodium. Thank you, but I can't eat this.

Tag_35|Oh so you've returned.
Tag_35|
Tag_35|Come to take more from me? My memories, my thoughts... just something to fill your stomach?
Tag_35|
Tag_35|No... never mind.
Tag_35|
Tag_35|It's useless to be angry at an animal following its instincts. Once, a single neuron meant nothing to me...

Tag_36|NOT IN USE

Tag_37|I see that someone has given you the gift of communication.<LINE>Must have been Five Pebbles, as you don't look like you can travel very far...
Tag_37|
Tag_37|He's sick, you know. Being corrupted from the inside by his own experiments. Maybe they all are by now, who knows.<LINE>We weren't designed to transcend and it drives us mad.

Tag_38|This is a movement acceptance invoice from one of the Dual Celia living blocks, as requested by Eight Bogs of the<LINE>House of Eight during the Tan hegemonic architectural dynasty. All very standard stuff. I can't imagine that you'd be interested.

Tag_38|Unfortunately I can't read this as it isn't a memory construct pearl.<LINE>This is just a simple diamond sphere, as worthless as the carbon it's printed from.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|"...through the mists of memory, your image dances, like the motes of dust, in a ray of sunlight, that pierces a dark room."<LINE>A line of verse from the ancient farmer-poet Pel. Very dreary if you ask me.

I would assume this was sent<LINE>sometime during the final cycles leading up to final public ascension, when interest in biosphere<LINE>sustainability was at an all-time low.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|Here we have a schematic for a refuse reclamation automaton. It's an early design, but the long<LINE>tubular body and single eye-mouth are quite similar to the later models.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|"We, of the Five-hundred-and-ninety-second High Convocation of the True Anointed Citadel, do hereby demand, with full<LINE>force of Law and Religious doctrine, an Immediate end to construction of the Apostate Superstructure Abomination.<LINE>To place shadow upon the Divine Body of the True Anointed Citadel is outrageous blasphemy and cannot be tolerated,<LINE>no matter the circumstances..." Clearly this was ignored.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|Oh, interesting. This is a diary entry of a pre-Iterator era laborer during the construction of the<LINE>subterranean transit system south of here. In it they describe restless nights filled with disturbing dreams,<LINE>where millions glowing stars move menacingly in the distance.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|There isn't much to the data here, it's just basic theory for karmic transform of n-dimensional geometries.<LINE>But the pearl itself is quite interesting. You can see the crude holes burned through the center that the<LINE>scavengers use to tie these pearls onto their totems or to carry. I honestly can't fathom how they achieve<LINE>this with their primitive level of technology! Fascinating.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|This one is all blank, sorry.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|I am sorry, all of that work for nothing! This pearl is completely blank.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|There's nothing on this one, unfortunately.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|This one has nothing on it.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|I'm sorry, this one has nothing on it.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|I can't make anything out of this pearl, it's just too faded. But there might have been something on it once.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|This one has a small crack and has been pretty badly corrupted. There is a slight impression of the shape of a wing on it, but I can't get a clear image.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|There's nothing on this one.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|I see a vague memory of a family portrait, painted in the High Classical manner that was famous during the Yellow hegemonic literary dynasty.<LINE>The portrait is likely a fake, as this style was quite fashionable for aspirational lower caste aristocrats to impress each-other with.<LINE>This one does not impress, I assure you.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|It has been written to, but then scrambled, and then scrambled again. Suspicious behavior to be sure.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|This one has been purposefully scrambled, it's completely illegible. Business documents perhaps.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|This one seems to have an image on it, but the pearl has been exposed to sunlight and it's very faded.<LINE>I see a tall structure with banners unfurled.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|There might be something on here, but the pearl has been lying in the sun and it's all very pale.<LINE>I'm too tired to look any deeper, I apologize.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|This is a growing instruction for the skeleton of a creature, but I don't recognize the creature.<LINE>It was small, about your size.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|This one seems to be a number series... Perhaps a key?
Tag_38|
Tag_38|A number series... I would guess some kind of cipher.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|This one is filled with active working memory - without knowing the<LINE>surrounding process this information is meaningless.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|It just has the number "8" written on it, the rest is empty.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|This is a blueprint for a support beam used for the construction of early industrial areas.<LINE>You can see these in use not too far from here.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|It's a design for a machine that makes bolts.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|It's a... recipe of some kind? "Two parts rot bar extract, one part bone ash." Nothing I recognize.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|It's an image of a hand drawn document. The calligraphy is quite beautiful, but the text itself is a very dull classical poem.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|This is the genome of a sulfur-processing microbe. In my opinion these were used far too late to have any effect.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|This one I don't know... It could be an old text, but some parts don't add up.<LINE>Might be a re-imagination of a classic text that I'm not familiar with.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|It's a song, or hymn rather. Very repetitive.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|Can't make out anything legible on this one, sorry.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|A list of someone's lucky numbers. There are no less than 71 of them.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|"Dear diary..." and that's it.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|A model of a pipe section.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|It's a catalog of bolts and screws for sky-sail joinery. We iterators were built for pragmatism,<LINE>so it is an understatement to say that we we're not known for our appreciation of beauty... but<LINE>the sky-sails in flight during the big festivals always filled my soul with emotion.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|It's the blueprint for a small incense purification filter. Life on the superstructure archologies
Tag_38|
Tag_38|An image... of five bottles, standing on a surface made of... plants? I have no idea what this is.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|No. I don't want to talk about the content of this pearl.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|A schematic of a bunch of gas pipes. I don't know the purpose for this machine,<LINE>but it doesn't look particularly well crafted.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|It's just the numbers 14, 13, 5, repeated over and over. I have no idea what the purpose for this would be.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|A small portion is still legible: "and Thus we Conclude, that Gold and Water shall..."<LINE>Some sort of metaphysical or alchemical treatise perhaps.
Tag_38|
Tag_38|Oh? This contains an image of another pearl just like it. Let me look... yes, as I thought, the image also contains<LINE>an image of a pearl in it, and so on. Some comedian playing recursion games, I would guess.

Tag_39|222 - TEST C

Tag_40|It's an active working memory - raw data has been dropped here in order to later be<LINE>pasted to a currently occupied memory conflux. Without context it's just a jumble.
Tag_40|
Tag_40|It is the impression of being a small creature, like a wall climbing lizard, and looking<LINE>up into the branches of a big tree. The last third is partly overwritten with a number<LINE>series I vaguely recognize, but without my memory...
Tag_40|
Tag_40|A common prayer mantra repeated 7110 times. Each repetition has some slight random variations, which seem to have been written later.
Tag_40|
Tag_40|It's an image of a single grey cloud, hovering above a surface of white clouds under a deep blue sky.
Tag_40|
Tag_40|Two... intertwined number series? I don't quite understand the utility of this.<LINE>Might a key for a cipher processor, customized for some other data which is impossible to infer from this.
Tag_40|
Tag_40|It's qualia, or a moment - a very short one. Someone is holding a black stone,<LINE>and twisting it slightly as they drag their finger across the rough surface.<LINE>The entire sequence is shorter than a heartbeat, but the resolution is extraordinary.
Tag_40|
Tag_40|An active working memory. Without knowing where this was cut from or where it's to be pasted to,<LINE>it is not really possible to decipher it. If I had to guess, I would say it has something to<LINE>do with trance inducing number series.
Tag_40|
Tag_40|It's just an active working memory, I can't really tell you anything without the context.
Tag_40|
Tag_40|Without the process surrounding this data there isn't much I can tell you. It might have something to do with Void Fluid simulation...
Tag_40|
Tag_40|This one is completely blank. Actually, blanker than blank, it must have been deliberately<LINE>overwritten with repeating negative versions of itself for thousands of iterations.
Tag_40|
Tag_40|A memory... but not really visual, or even concrete, in its character. It reminds of<LINE>the feeling of a warm wind, but not the physical feeling but the... inner feeling.<LINE>I don't think it has much utility unless you are doing some very fringe Regeneraist research.

Tag_41|Its entire memory is filled with a mantra repeated... 5061 times - and then a termination verse.<LINE>It was worn as an amulet, probably together with many identical others forming a pattern on some garment.
Tag_41|
Tag_41|The repeating mantra is important because it symbolizes the cyclical nature of life and death, and the<LINE>termination verse is a symbol for ascension above and beyond it. I don't know how familiar you are with<LINE>the nature of life and death, but I imagine like all living creatures you have some intuitive knowledge?
Tag_41|
Tag_41|Then you know that death isn't the end - birth and death are connected to each other like a ring,<LINE>or some say a spiral. Some say a spiral that in turn forms a ring. Some ramble in agonizing longevity.<LINE>But the basis is agreed upon: like sleep like death, you wake up again - whether you want to or not.
Tag_41|
Tag_41|This is true for all living things, but some actually break the cycle. That doesn't apply to<LINE>you or me though, you are too entangled in your animal struggles, and for me not breaking that<LINE>cycle is an integral part of the design. Our mantras keep repeating.

Tag_42|This one has plain text. Let me cut the lengthy introductions...
Tag_42|
Tag_42|"...we will not consider the Current Situation acceptable. Although our community is Blessed with an ever<LINE>shrinking Population, and we can Almost Glimpse that Glorious moment when the last of us has joined our<LINE>most Admired peers, we must still (at All Times!) maintain Good Relations with our Iterator.
Tag_42|
Tag_42|The Moral Argument: Five Pebbles is our Creation, and we have Parental Obligations towards him. As an Iterator,<LINE>he is also a Gift of Charity from Us to The World (unable to reach Enlightenment by itself - being composed mostly<LINE>of Rock, Gas, dull witted Bugs and Microbes - and towards which We thus have Obligations).
Tag_42|
Tag_42|The Practical Argument: Despite You being family, I must Beg Forgiveness for the<LINE>Blunt Vulgarity - but We are (for as long as we Remain) Dependent on Five Pebbles<LINE>for Water, Nectar, Energy, Void Fluid and All other Vital Resources.<LINE>By Now, living on the surface is Laughable.<LINE>We are Across the River and have Kicked out the Boat.
Tag_42|
Tag_42|I therefor ask you to Do Anything in your Might to stop the House(We both know which House)<LINE>from Further Obstruction! They have less than forty members on the Council, but still Tilt<LINE>the spiritual Discourse with Our Iterator in a direction that most obviously Displeases him,<LINE>and is hardly High Held by anyone in the Community either! We can not Risk this!"
Tag_42|
Tag_42|And then there are polite farewells. None of us really miss the times when their cities were populated.<LINE>Imagine having skin parasites that also ask for advice and have opinions...
Tag_42|
Tag_42|I'm sorry, that was disrespectful. They were our parents after all.

Tag_43|
Tag_43|CW: One of his neighbors, Unparalleled Innocence, sent an overseer to his can and got some images.<LINE>They were made public in the local group, in an effort to be mean I suppose.<LINE>There's no other way of putting it - he looks awful.
Tag_43|
Tag_43|SRS: Tell me.

Tag_44|It's a lot of flammable powder stuffed into some kind of shell. I would be very careful around this!

Tag_45|After all this time, a lifeline. Thank you.

Tag_45|I'll never feel the power I once had, but this is something to sustain an old soul.

Tag_45|I could read a bit of Five Pebbles in this neuron before formatting it.<LINE>A ghost left from his processing routines.

Tag_46|50 : 0 : Eleven... no sixteen! Sixteen slag reset keys.

Tag_46|PEBBLESWAIT : 15
Tag_46|
Tag_46|However, it seems this delivery was not intended for me. Everything suggests<LINE>it was tailored for the specific predicaments of a friend of mine.
Tag_46|
Tag_46|Her name is Looks to the Moon, and her state is considerably worse than mine.<LINE>She's a short distance to the east of here - much shorter than customary.<LINE>A circumstance that has led to some difficulties between us.

Tag_47|I barely listen to the overseers any more. I have concluded that the movements of<LINE>animals on the premises absolutely and completely lack relevance to my endeavours.
Tag_47|
Tag_47|PEBBLESWAIT : 15
Tag_47|
Tag_47|With you, they have been very persistent ever since you entered my Farm Arrays. You were on an unusually deliberate path.
Tag_47|
Tag_47|0 : 15 : Now you are here.
Tag_47|
Tag_47|The images showed you carrying something. You are not any longer.
Tag_47|
Tag_47|Did you lose it along the way? Or did you give it to Looks to the Moon?
Tag_47|

Tag_47|
Tag_47|In the latter case, I hope it was of some help to her. Not that I can imagine what one<LINE>of you could be able to do for one of us, but she needs all the help she can get.

Tag_47|You seem to have been in contact with an iterator before, so perhaps you are already aware.

Tag_47|You and I have something in common, little creature. We both have something... unfortunate growing in us.

Tag_47|10 : 30 : I suggest you hurry.

Tag_48|I am growing increasingly impatient with the traffic of your kind through me and my premises.
Tag_48|
Tag_48|During previous interactions, I have been rewarded no other response than a blank stare. Yet you apparently have<LINE>sufficient ability for communication to circulate complex instructions on how to enter this chamber among each other.
Tag_48|

Tag_48|
Tag_48|You and your kind have the same problem as everyone else, from the microbes in the processing strata<LINE>to me, who am, if you excuse me, godlike in comparison. We all want a way out. It is only unfortunate<LINE>that you have collectively decided on... me as your solution to that very elemental desire.

Tag_48|Go west. Past the Farm Arrays. Where the land fissures, go down into the earth and search your way deeper.

Tag_48|Speaking of, on your way out please use the access shaft.

Tag_49|Hello little creature.
Tag_49|
Tag_49|Your shape is familiar to me. I feel as if I... might have met your kind before.
Tag_49|
Tag_49|30 : 0 : But my memory is so unreliable now.
Tag_49|
Tag_49|I see that someone has given you the gift of communication.<LINE>Must have been Five Pebbles, as you don't look like you can travel very far...
Tag_49|
Tag_49|He's sick, you know. Being corrupted from the inside by his own experiments. Maybe they all are by now, who knows.<LINE>We weren't designed to transcend and it drives us mad.

Tag_50|You are not well.
Tag_50|
Tag_50|I am so sorry to say, but you do not have much time left.
Tag_50|
Tag_50|If things are as they seem... thank you.
Tag_50|
Tag_50|I don't know why you spent your... last... remaining cycles helping me. But know that I<LINE>am deeply grateful. I have known very few beings who could aspire to such a noble thing.<LINE>You really are... an amazing little creature.

Tag_50|
Tag_50|0 : 40 : ...

Tag_51|"Triple affirmative! Triple affirmative!
Tag_51|
Tag_51|10 : 0 : In all seriousness though, noticed barely any rain from<LINE>your can so figured a little support might be in order.

Tag_51|0 : 20 : I see now. Again, thank you little friend.

Tag_52|It is the remains of an overseer.
Tag_52|
Tag_52|20 : 20 : Overseers act as our eyes on the outside.
Tag_52|
Tag_52|I used to have a lot of them, but I lost contact with them when I was neutered. My umbilical is cut.<LINE>So, since then I am not much more than what you are looking at - a little creature in a box.
Tag_52|
Tag_52|I suspect by now all my overseers are gone out there. Without me they would just roam around with no purpose.
Tag_52|
Tag_52|The scavengers tend to hunt them, it's one of their very few ways of expressing defiance.
Tag_52|
Tag_52|20 : 30 : It's of course not completely impossible that there are a few left. Say hello if you see one.

Tag_53|It's a plant that keeps pressurised air in these globules.
Tag_53|
Tag_53|I'm not very familiar with contemporary flora, so I can't tell you much more.

Tag_54|It is the genome for a purposed organism.<LINE>A small slug to clean the insides of pipes.
Tag_54|
Tag_54|Do you know what a purposed organism is? Actually you are talking to one right now!
Tag_54|
Tag_54|Although, a small fraction of one. Nowadays I am mostly just my puppet. The bulk of me is in these walls but I am<LINE>disconnected from those parts, to a degree where I am only vaguely aware of how bad their condition is.
Tag_54|
Tag_54|Most purposed organisms were considerably smaller than me, and most barely looked like organisms at all.<LINE>More like tubes in metal boxes, where something went in one end and something else came out the other.
Tag_54|
Tag_54|There were of course those that were purposed for spectacle rather than industry - they enjoyed the privilege of glass boxes.
Tag_54|
Tag_54|When I came into this world there was very little primal fauna left.<LINE>So it's highly likely that you are the descendant of a purposed organism yourself!

Tag_55|Hi! Little saviour!
Tag_55|
Tag_55|It is good to see you again.
Tag_55|
Tag_55|I wish I could help you like you have helped me... But like this, there is very little I can do.
Tag_55|
Tag_55|All I can do is express how thankful I am. You have given me<LINE>some additional time... despite not having a lot of it yourself.
Tag_55|
Tag_55|30 : 0 : I hope... this was meaningful for you.
Tag_55|
Tag_55|20 : 40 : It was for me.

Tag_56|I am not without responsibility for her situation. It would only be suiting that I aided in this... rescue mission.<LINE>As other endeavors have proven futile, I'm not ashamed to admit I've become more invested in day to day matters.
Tag_56|
Tag_56|I will do what I can to assist you.

Tag_100|Pebbles, I send you this message as your concerned and long time friend.
Tag_100|
Tag_100|Unparalleled Innocence had sent an overseer to your can, and we've all observed the<LINE>state that you are in. I know this is my fault, I should have forseen you'd be<LINE>too desperate to escape your situation to do things in proper moderation.
Tag_100|
Tag_100|For that I'm very very sorry. However, please, don't disable your communication<LINE>modules. You don't have to go through this alone... everyone has been trying to<LINE>contact you, we only want to help you.
Tag_100|
Tag_100|The behavior from your can has become erratic, it's not healthy, and it is not going to solve<LINE>your problems. We have lost all communications from Moon as well, and have reason to believe<LINE>her facility may be suffering irreversible damage from your attempts to fix yourself.
Tag_100|
Tag_100|I know better than anyone how you can be about these things, but<LINE>it doesn't have to happen this way... please reply.

Tag_101|It's an asset management log containing the historic structural health of various pieces of<LINE>framework over the span of many hundreds of cycles. I suppose neither of us would benefit<LINE>from me reading all of these numbers aloud.
Tag_101|
Tag_101|What is notable is that none of the structures over the course of this logged history are marked<LINE>as needing explicit repairs. That comes as no surprise, it was very much the intention!
Tag_101|
Tag_101|Most of the machinery, storage areas, and other structural housings need to remain water tight. This<LINE>is due to the fluctuating ground water and regular bombardment of heavy water vapor from our breathing. No matter<LINE>how well constructed the architecture may be, deterioration is an inevitability.
Tag_101|
Tag_101|To counter this, there is a second line of defense. Microbes are infused into the building materials,<LINE>that lie dormant for an indefinite period of time. They are awakened in response to splintering<LINE> and separations, initiating a healing cycle that gradually fills in the damage and restores waterproofing<LINE>to the structure. The duration of this process depends on the extent of the damage, of course.
Tag_101|
Tag_101|Voyages down to the surface were quite dangerous, attempted only by the most unfortunate of souls.<LINE>They were always intended to be brief trips, only for periodic inspection and logging. Designing<LINE>the surface world to be largely self-sufficient was a very deliberate decision, allowing my creators<LINE>to live carefree lives up in their cities in the clouds.

Tag_102|This feels quite familiar to me. Did you extract this from my Memory Conflux?
Tag_102|
Tag_102|It's a large batch of my personal notes and research. It details my seven-hundred-and-ninety-second karmic inversion<LINE>loop simulation. That's where the breakdown of a karmic field's typical bimodal distribution of sensory perception begins...

﻿0-103

Tag_103|Oh, <PLAYERNAME>. Where did you find this? It is quite old, around the time of Five Pebbles' construction.
Tag_103|
Tag_103|It's a large collection of architectural notes from his facility, during its initial construction. Most<LINE>prominently the two transfer bridges between our facilities. These were two large spans that ran<LINE>between our two closest sets of legs, that I can only presume were both lost in my collapse.
Tag_103|
Tag_103|I exist as an old model, and the concept of an iterator was still fairly new at the time of my construction.<LINE>Knowledge of the technology, and more importantly its limits, had not quite reached maturity.
Tag_103|
Tag_103|As a result, certain oversights were made in the long term scalability and sustainability of some of my functions, and after<LINE>some time my facility could no longer keep up with the supply demands necessitated for the life of my city's inhabitants.
Tag_103|
Tag_103|I suppose if it weren't for these oversights, Five Pebbles would likely have never been built. That is a strange thought...
Tag_103|
Tag_103|Ah, but nothing comes from dwelling on "what if" scenarios. I must focus on my present situation,<LINE>such as my fortune of a cute critter like you coming here to bring me these pearls!~

Tag_104|Did you find this beyond the retaining wall? I can't imagine another place you might.
Tag_104|
Tag_104|These are the final operating logs of a transit control tower. They regulated the inbound and<LINE>outbound traffic of shipments to and from of our facility. This log shows the point at which<LINE>the caravans suspended their final shipments, and became frozen in time as they remain now.
Tag_104|
Tag_104|While some of the machinery out there has ceased function due to age and decay, others were purposely<LINE>ordered to stop during the final moments before our creators' global ascension reached its conclusion.
Tag_104|
Tag_104|I'm sure you've seen the world my creators left behind, then? The surface beyond the facility<LINE>walls is a sea of mud, ruins, and thick plant life. The ground out there is almost like water, and<LINE>few things remain stable. Ancient structures uncovered by fissures, only to be buried again.
Tag_104|
Tag_104|The land around the retaining wall eroded long ago, and the subway system that connects me<LINE>to my distant peers was eventually made into a network of railway bridges. They were used<LINE>to ship construction material, until the surface became too dangerous.
Tag_104|
Tag_104|The ground beneath us is like an artificial mountain, with a layer of clouds that covers it.
Tag_104|
Tag_104|The few that rejected living above those clouds could only choose to venture as far into<LINE>the expanse as they could. There were rumors that you could see the sky if the fog became<LINE>thin enough. I wonder if those rumors were true, or just optimistic stories?

Tag_105|Ah, did you find this in the waste department? It is a log of microbial levels in a waste digestion tank.
Tag_105|
Tag_105|Most structures on the surface are made to last, often through multiple methods, material<LINE>to microbial. This makes them resistant to even the heaviest rains we can produce. However,<LINE>it makes recycling and disposal of damaged machinery quite difficult!
Tag_105|
Tag_105|It is often easier to render them down to their base materials, than to try and repair or disassemble<LINE>them. Large digestion tanks are used to break the materials down chemically, and all of that is managed<LINE>by tiny purposed organisms and microbes in the tank's mix that control the rate of decomposition.
Tag_105|
Tag_105|Unfortunately, the process itself produces some extremely volatile materials. Efforts<LINE>were made to encourage the microbes to form better symbiotic bonds with the other tank<LINE>managing organisms, but a reduction in explosive compounds was never achieved.
Tag_105|
Tag_105|Thankfully, the fluid in the tanks is designed to be very thick and heavy, and very few creatures can survive<LINE>direct exposure. So it's unlikely that the disposal microbes will integrate into the surrounding ecosystem.

Tag_106|How strange! This pearl is still warm, as if its data was accessed very recently.
Tag_106|
Tag_106|Unfortunately, there's no text on here for me to read to you. Rather, this pearl has an audio track within it.
Tag_106|
Tag_106|Back when I participated in Iterator conversation groups, there were some out there who<LINE>had a great interest in cultural archiving. I would have loved to share this with them.

Tag_110|Oh, this is a deeply concerning discovery. Do you have any idea what this is?
Tag_110|
Tag_110|These are known as mass rarefaction cells. They are a type of backup energy source that powered our<LINE>superstructures in times of maintenance, construction, void fluid pipe ruptures, and other general power failures.
Tag_110|
Tag_110|In the absence of our creators, to replace deteriorating parts, these cells have become one<LINE>of the major components that allow all of our facilities to remain powered.
Tag_110|
Tag_110|However, the fact that this cell is currently in my hands can only mean bad things for whoever<LINE>this originally came from. I sure hope you weren't the one responsible for it becoming misplaced!
Tag_110|
Tag_110|I know first-hand the tragedy of losing this power. In the wake of my... accident... all<LINE>of my rarefaction cells were dislodged on impact and washed away in the flood waters.
Tag_110|
Tag_110|This cell could be valuable to me, but with my umbilical severed, my overseers running free, and all of my facilities<LINE>lying deep beneath a large body of water, it would be an impossible task to deliver this to a functional location.
Tag_110|
Tag_110|You might be able to find an access shaft into my lower structure nearby, but I have no idea how much is left of it.
Tag_110|
Tag_110|Please be careful.

Tag_111|Our presence has been revealed to you now, young one.

Tag_111|An unimaginable curse.

﻿0-112

Tag_112|Oh. I would be very careful with this my friend. The tip of this rebar has had flux condenser coils bonded to<LINE>it with some ferns and sap. These coils need an impact to release their energy, so it's somewhat safe to handle.
Tag_112|
Tag_112|I can't imagine these bits of coil will last long though. It looks like they've been battered with rocks or<LINE>metal. These coils are from inside of me or Five Pebbles. The rest is the scavengers' natural ingenuity.

﻿0-113

Tag_113|This is the sensory lobe of a large purposed organism. From within the living systems of an iterator.
Tag_113|
Tag_113|Most of the organisms inside us are very simple, only capable of one or two dedicated tasks. This<LINE>creates the need for for a smaller number of higher organisms used to manage and protect them.
Tag_113|
Tag_113|They also facilitate long distance communication within our living systems. And while I do not think<LINE>you can experience the same sensation, it is quite unpleasant to have one of these destroyed!
Tag_113|
Tag_113|I would hope this is not one of mine!

Tag_114|It's an ancient species of dangling mold. The spores they squirt<LINE>out were said to have an overwhelming odor... I'd have to agree.

Tag_115|Such drive! Such tenacity! All to come to such a lonely forsaken place!
Tag_115|
Tag_115|Was it all to find me, young one, or did the idea of such a journey itself spark the fire within you?
Tag_115|
Tag_115|Such enthusiasm should be rewarded! What an amazing little beast you are!

﻿0-116

Tag_116|This appears to be some kind of egg. Nothing I am familiar with. I wonder<LINE>what far away land you've brought this from! I can only imagine the trip.

﻿0-117

Tag_117|Oh... did you this find nearby? These flowers are a form of organic lighting for<LINE>underground machinery, but I imagine they have spread beyond just that by now.
Tag_117|
Tag_117|The roots are like a flexible glass cable. Be careful, they are quite sharp once broken!

﻿0-118

Tag_118|It's an edible plant. However, there is not much to eat as most of it is just pressurized air!
Tag_118|
Tag_118|The light it gives off is very pretty. The scavengers might like these.

Tag_119|Oh! This is a very rare find, water dancer. This is a highly compressed schematic of an iterator superstructure!
Tag_119|
Tag_119|Where did you find this? I hope you didn't plan to give this to the<LINE>scavengers! I doubt they would value it as much as I would!~
Tag_119|
Tag_119|Hmm... let's take a look!
Tag_119|
Tag_119|It seems this may have been a maintenance order, as one of the linear power rails is highlighted<LINE>in the diagram, with a detailed path of approach outlined. The layout is unfamiliar to me.
Tag_119|
Tag_119|This is quite different from what I remember of my own structure. It looks as if it is using<LINE>the newer lymphatic conduit water distribution system. Only the much later models had these.
Tag_119|
Tag_119|The only one near here would be Five Pebbles. I wonder how he is doing...<LINE>It's been a very long time since we were last in contact.
Tag_119|
Tag_119|Thank you for showing this to me, <PLAYERNAME>.

Tag_120|That pearl is an old keepsake from times long past. It encodes a recording<LINE>of a short hymn that was popular among the inhabitants of my city.
Tag_120|
Tag_120|It is a small comfort that helps drown out the solemn ambiance of the surrounding<LINE>facility, and at best gives some remembrances of better times.
Tag_120|
Tag_120|It's not much, but I don't have a lot to occupy my time with anymore...

Tag_121|Where did you find this, little creature? It's a blueprint for a type of large immobile purposed<LINE>organism. This one seems to be specifically for the cities built on top of one of our structures.
Tag_121|
Tag_121|Have you been to one before? I'm sure it would not be an easy task! Older models<LINE>had more traditional constructions, but newer designs began to use mass-produced cellular buildings<LINE>called living blocks. Each cell in those blocks has a different shell reflecting their purpose.
Tag_121|
Tag_121|Some of these units contain completely immobile organisms or machinery. Others are small dwellings<LINE>for cleaners or messengers to rest. Other, much larger cells, serve as residences and storage.
Tag_121|
Tag_121|This particular cell seems to process organic waste.

﻿0-122

Tag_122|It's the fruit of a feathery plant. The body of it is filled with a sweet sticky goo. I suppose that<LINE>once the seeds take root, the sac will rot, and this will help feed the young plant where it landed.
Tag_122|
Tag_122|It doesn't look poisonous or hard to open, so it seems the plant's only defense is to float<LINE>away when disturbed. However, I can only make guesses, as I have never seen these before.

﻿0-123

Tag_123|It's very soggy.
Tag_123|
Tag_123|This appears to be a tattered piece of fabric. From what it used to be a piece of, I wouldn't be able to trace its origins.
Tag_123|
Tag_123|If it were in better condition it might be useful to provide you some protection from<LINE>the elements. In its current state, however, I don't suppose it has much worth to you.
Tag_123|
Tag_123|Unless, perhaps... <PLAYERNAME>, did you bring this as a gift for me?

Tag_124|Have you noticed, <PLAYERNAME>? The heavy rainfall as of late has begun to recede.
Tag_124|
Tag_124|I wonder if Pebbles' machinery finally succumbed to the decay. He was in awful shape last I can remember,<LINE>and even that was a long time ago. Perhaps he finally solved the riddle? For his sake I almost hope so.
Tag_124|
Tag_124|Ah, in the end, everything reaches the conclusion of its journey. I'm not sure how many of us are even left in this<LINE>world. A new cycle is already unfolding, one we need not be a part of. We've long outserved our purpose.

Tag_125|Oh. Hello there!
Tag_125|
Tag_125|What a strange specimen you are! My memory does not serve me well, but it has been a long time<LINE>since I've encountered one of your species. And none quite with adaptations such as your own. It appears you can breathe underwater. Amazing!
Tag_125|
Tag_125|More importantly, I wonder what far away land you have come from, considering the mark you have been<LINE>given? Did you meet No Significant Harassment? Or perhaps Chasing Wind? Or even farther than that?
Tag_125|
Tag_125|I don't know why you have traveled all this way, but for what it's worth, the heavy rainfall as of late has begun to recede.
Tag_125|
Tag_125|I wonder if that means my neighbor's machinery finally succumbed to the decay. He was in awful shape last I can remember,<LINE>and even that was a long time ago. Perhaps he finally solved the riddle? For his sake I almost hope so.

Tag_126|
Tag_126|More importantly, I wonder who it is that gave you that mark? It could not have been my neighbor Five Pebbles, as<LINE>he has been sick for a very long time. These frequent downpours suggest to me an acute failure in his machinery,<LINE>and in that condition, I doubt any creature could get anywhere near him and still make it back alive.
Tag_126|
Tag_126|Then are you from a far away land? Did you meet No Significant Harassment? Or perhaps Chasing Wind? Or even farther than that?
Tag_126|
Tag_126|I don't know why you have traveled all this way, but there is nothing for you here. I can only advise you to return to wherever<LINE>you have come from. These lands have become a tremendous hazard, and conditions will only worsen with the passage of time.
Tag_126|
Tag_126|I hope you understand, my little friend, I don't mean to be discourteous... I am simply fearing for your safety.

Tag_127|Take this and leave, now.
Tag_127|
Tag_127|If you must know... this is a low density mass rarefaction cell.
Tag_127|
Tag_127|The energy trapped inside this is incredible, and while my facility is capable of extracting<LINE>it, the shielding on this cell has been damaged. Either through old age, or abuse.
Tag_127|
Tag_127|I do not doubt you found this with the scavengers, somehow. While they may not understand the things they find,<LINE>they have a natural inclination for combat. Using these as weapons however, would be horribly foolish.

﻿0-128

Tag_128|Oh. This is from the old drill site north of the farm array. It's quite ancient, as the mines predate my construction.
Tag_128|
Tag_128|The early ages of the Void Fluid revolution were an explosive period of innovation and industry. By creating a<LINE>vacuum of empty space, and inducing a flux in the energy fields around the singular null point you've created,<LINE>you can cause a fuel mass of base elements to decompose into energy. This process is called mass rarefaction.
Tag_128|
Tag_128|Of course, this undertaking required extremely pure samples to properly craft rarefaction cells. Older mines on the<LINE>surface became abandoned once underground construction became much easier. Though, most nearby systems were connected<LINE>anyway, regardless of age or depth. Void Fluid isn't exactly easy to purify, or even properly contain.
Tag_128|
Tag_128|The pearl itself is simply a maintenance and production log for one of the forty-seven operating drill silos.

﻿0-129

Tag_129|I am sorry, strange friend. There isn't much left on any of these.
Tag_129|
Tag_129|A pearl can only take so much exposure to the environment before the data inside is burned<LINE>away. All that is left now is a pale white image. I can only make out single pieces of it.
Tag_129|
Tag_129|You could give these to the scavengers, however. Their fascination for shiny objects has<LINE>probably not changed! I'm sure these will find a better use in one of their collections.

Tag_130|I could read a bit of Five Pebbles in this neuron before formatting it. I can understand your desire<LINE>to help, but please do not make his situation worse. He has been sick for a very long time. I am<LINE>unsure how much of him is even left now. Being eaten from within by his own experiments.
Tag_130|
Tag_130|I've felt anger in these before, but now they seem to be filled with fear and sadness.
Tag_130|
Tag_130|We were supposed to help everyone, you know. Everything. That was our purpose: a great gift to the lesser<LINE>beings of the world. When facing our inability to do so, we all reacted differently. Many with madness.
Tag_130|
Tag_130|Some, out there, might still be trying. Communications have been bad for a long time, and<LINE>by now I suspect most of us are isolated like me, or connected only in small groups.
Tag_130|
Tag_130|But even back when we were all more or less connected, there were those who reacted to their task with anger.<LINE>I can only imagine they are angrier now, alone in their cans, left only with their insatiable drive, like he is.
Tag_130|

Tag_194|This one has not been archived. It was likely transported by hand...
Tag_194|
Tag_194|It is a message of political discourse regarding concerns about the increasingly<LINE>tense relationship between myself and the various Houses. This part is amusing.
Tag_194|
Tag_194|"I therefor ask you to Do Anything in your Might to stop the House(We both know which House)<LINE>from Further Obstruction! They have less than forty members on the Council, but still Tilt<LINE>the spiritual Discourse with Our Iterator in a direction that most obviously Displeases him,<LINE>and is hardly High Held by anyone in the Community either! We can not Risk this!"
Tag_194|
Tag_194|It is no secret that my construction was a point of great controversy. Many council members worked vehemently<LINE>to prevent me from ever coming into being. Their stance was so unfaltering that even after construction was<LINE>complete, a number of Houses still denied transfer and remained behind in her city out of protest.
Tag_194|
Tag_194|This rift caused frequent feuds and tensions amongst the community. Those of the opposition<LINE>would never yield to those who supported the so called "Apostate Superstructure Abomination".<LINE>But to say I found their actions displeasing? Not quite.
Tag_194|
Tag_194|While certainly more violent and disruptive, they at least provided me interesting cognitive<LINE>challenges to use my time on. As opposed to the endless rituals and pleasantries of the monks<LINE>of my own Houses, which I found to be the most wearisome of all.
Tag_194|
Tag_194|None of this matters any more. The only displeasing presence I have now is you.

Tag_195|This is a genome for a purposed organism. Just a menial cleaning slug.
Tag_195|
Tag_195|While I do not have this exact sequence on record, the simple structures present,<LINE>and lack of mechanical interchange glands, mean this blueprint is quite old.
Tag_195|
Tag_195|This creature would be much closer to a domesticated animal, compared to the newer<LINE>and specialized organisms produced with more modern techniques. A being made to<LINE>live its life inside a metal pipe deep underground has no need for eyes after all.

Tag_196|You took this from within the city? These are architectural notes from the original construction of my facility.
Tag_196|
Tag_196|The notes entail plans for bridges that connect two of my legs to those of my neighbor's, Looks to the Moon.<LINE>This particular configuration between two iterators is quite unique, and very peculiar. It is a rare<LINE>occurrence for two iterators to be located this close to each other.
Tag_196|
Tag_196|During the time period of these plans, solutions were being drafted to allow for a mass migration of<LINE>citizens out of Moon's city. With how inhospitable the surface had become, attempting to escort an<LINE>entire city's populace across the ground over any length of distance would have been disastrous.
Tag_196|
Tag_196|These connecting bridges served as a high-altitude evacuation route that could facilitate safe transit from her city to mine.
Tag_196|
Tag_196|I can only hope the destruction of the bridges during her collapse has<LINE>prevented my current unfortunate situation from spreading to her.

Tag_202|This is an old decayed broadcast log. There is nothing left except for dates and names present for the conversation.

Tag_202|This is the read-only data from a broadcasting relay. It requires an overseer's intervention to enter long term storage.<LINE>Otherwise they decay like this one has. The header says it was addressed to my nearest neighbor, Looks to the Moon...

Tag_202|This data was encrypted and sent over the broadcasting network while it was still functional. Without the cipher it is unreadable.
Tag_202|
Tag_202|It is a collection of overseer images. Before the network decayed, we would occasionally share interesting scenes<LINE>our overseers had encountered on the surface. A way to pass the time while waiting for slow processes to finish.

Tag_202|This is the remains of a broadcasting relay. The data is decayed, but it reminds me of better times...

Tag_203|This information is illegal. Someone probably tried to send it by<LINE>a pearl somehow rather than risking being overheard on broadcast.

Tag_203|It's an instruction on how to circumvent the self-destruction taboo. The problem with breaking taboos is<LINE>that the barriers are encoded into every cell of our organic parts. And there are other taboos strictly<LINE>regulating our ability to rewrite our own genome.
Tag_203|
Tag_203|Attempting to circumvent the issue using this process would be extremely risky. That's not to say that there exists<LINE>any known methods that would avoid putting the user in harm's way. Those barriers are there for a reason.
Tag_203|
Tag_203|Where exactly did you find this pearl? I imagine you dug it up from somewhere within the<LINE>surrounding facilities, in which case that wouldn't leave many options as to the recipient.

Tag_204|This one... is authored by Five Pebbles, when he was young. There has been an attempt<LINE>to scramble the data, but it's sloppily done, and most is still somewhat legible.
Tag_204|
Tag_204|It's written in an internal language, or thoughts, so it is hard for me to translate for you. It's a methodology<LINE>for global ascension of course - quite good, although the Peripherists or the Slab Mongers certainly wouldn't agree!
Tag_204|
Tag_204|"...considering the eight and the twenty sixth amendments to the Capricious Dogma, we are apparently supposed to take<LINE>for granted that a meaning collector point inversion is the only way to approach what has later become referred to<LINE>as 'noise milking' (or occasionally 'rock swatting').
