ec-Chimney1|Behold this empty husk of a land...
ec-Chimney2|Populated only by storms, ruins and abominations. It wasn't always thus.
ec-Chimney3|I was once the Count of 2 living blocks, esteemed by my peers. I had progeny!
ec-Chimney4|From within my vessel of flesh, I would perch upon this spot to observe the rising of the sun.
ec-Chimney5|Corporeal matters seem so distant now. Most have forgotten this place, but I remain.
ec-Chimney6|Perhaps I reminisce because I cannot go. Perhaps I cannot go because memory traps me here.

ec-Sky1|Do you hear it, little one?
ec-Sky2|The buzzing in the air?
ec-Sky3|The endless chatter of a thousand thousand voices, long dead?
ec-Sky4|They are gone, and yet they speak. Neither here nor there.
ec-Sky5|Does that seem familiar? Yes, it is quite amusing for a being in my predicament!

ec-Farm1|Strange...
ec-Farm2|Something still draws me here. Even after all this time.
ec-Farm3|The weather is so different now, but the fields...
ec-Farm4|I do not need eyes to know that the grasses still sway gently in the winds.
ec-Farm5|To have grasped at the boundless infinites of the cosmic void...
ec-Farm6|Yet here I am contemplating these same fields as I once did, talking to some sort of rodent.

ec-Shaded1|You have no name.
ec-Shaded2|I once had! I was embalmed, adorned, readied for the journey.
ec-Shaded3|So proud. There was jubilation! My name was sung, loud and clear.
ec-Shaded4|Did they know? That I didn't quite leave, didn't quite stay?
ec-Shaded5|Should I be ashamed? That I linger here, where my memories are kept?
ec-Shaded6|Should I be ashamed that I now envy your flesh prison?

ec-Wall1|We can feel your presence, little creature.
ec-Wall2|Your attunement has become... much closer to ours.
ec-Wall3|The mark you received is an unimaginable gift.
ec-Wall4|The struggle, the cycles...
ec-Wall5|It can all fade, like a morning mist beneath the glory of the sun.
ec-Wall6|We found a way.

ec-Sub1|A little beast!
ec-Sub|But not as dim as the rest, perhaps?
ec-Sub|So down into the depths you go as many others before you, drawn to the void again and again, an endless drip drip drip.
ec-Sub|Much like these tunnels and caves that amuse me so. The bones of forgotten civilizations, heaped like so many sticks.
ec-Sub|Did they dig too deep, or not deep enough?
ec-Sub|Fools. We were right to drill straight through them!

// Moon Pearl Dialouge

it-lttm-pearl-CC1|This information is illegal. Someone probably tried to send it by<LINE>a pearl somehow rather than risking being overheard on broadcast.
it-lttm-pearl-CC2|I think the risk of you acting on this is very slim, so I'll go ahead and explain it to you.<LINE>It's an instruction on how to circumvent the self-destruction taboo.
it-lttm-pearl-CC3|The problem with breaking taboos is that the barriers are encoded<LINE>into every cell of our organic parts. And there are other taboos<LINE>strictly regulating our ability to rewrite our own genome.
it-lttm-pearl-CC4|So what you need is to somehow create a small sample of living organic matter<LINE>which can procreate and act on the rest of your organic matter to re-write its genome.<LINE>The re-write has to be very specific, overriding the specific taboo you want to<LINE>circumvent but do nothing else.
it-lttm-pearl-CC5|The method described here is about scrambling the genome of standard<LINE>plastic neural tissue with temperature fluctuations. After each scramble<LINE>you browse the resulting cells for the genome you're after.<LINE>This is of course extremely time consuming, unless you run a<LINE>big number of parallel processes.
it-lttm-pearl-CC6|I definitely don't have any experience with this, but to me it would<LINE>seem that too many parallel processes would be quite dangerous, as it would<LINE>be exponentially more difficult to manage and control them all.<LINE>The whole operation seems rather risky if you ask me.
it-lttm-pearl-CC7|It might be a good thing that this pearl never reached its destination.

it-lttm-pearl-LF_west1|This one is just plain text. I will read it to you.
it-lttm-pearl-LF_west2|"On regards of the (by spiritual splendor eternally graced) people of the Congregation of Never Dwindling Righteousness,<LINE>we Wish to congratulate (o so thankfully) this Facility on its Loyal and Relished services, and to Offer our Hopes and<LINE>Aspirations that the Fruitful and Mutually Satisfactory Cooperation may continue, for as long as the Stars stay fixed on their<LINE>Celestial Spheres and/or the Cooperation continues to be Fruitful and Mutually Satisfactory."
it-lttm-pearl-LF_west3|"It is with Honor I, Eight Suns-Countless Leaves, of the House of Six Wagons, Count of no living blocks, Counselor of 2, Duke of 1,<LINE>Humble Secretary of the Congregation of Never Dwindling Righteousness, write this to You."
it-lttm-pearl-LF_west4|"We hope that the Crops are healthy, and that the Productivity with which your Facility is Blessed, leads (as it often does)<LINE>to further Prosperity. May Not as long as the Stars stay fixed on their Celestial Spheres Grey Hand, Impure Blood,<LINE>Inheritable Corruption, Parasites, or malfunction settle in Your establishment."
it-lttm-pearl-LF_west5|"Leaning on the Solid Foundation of our Long Running Fruitful and Mutually Satisfactory Cooperation, we will take the liberty of stating<LINE>The Reason for this Message ~ we write to Warmly thank You for yet Another Timely and Appreciated delivery of your Product (Nectar) to our<LINE>Community (Congregation of Never Dwindling Righteousness). Our humble Words can never Aspire to Describe our gratitude."
it-lttm-pearl-LF_west6|"Sincerely..." And then the name and titles again.
it-lttm-pearl-LF_west7|It's a confirmation to an automated farming plot that a shipment of beverages has arrived.

it-lttm-pearl-LF_bottom1|It's a Small Plate, a little text of spiritual guidance.<LINE>It's written by a monk called Four Cabinets, Eleven Hatchets.<LINE>It's old, several ages before the Void Fluid revolution.
it-lttm-pearl-LF_bottom2|Like most writing from this time it's quite shrouded in analogies, but the subject is how to shed<LINE>one of the five natural urges which tie a creature to life. Namely number four, gluttony.
it-lttm-pearl-LF_bottom3|It is basically an instruction on how to starve yourself<LINE>on herbal tea and gravel, but disguised as a poem.
it-lttm-pearl-LF_bottom4|Now of course when Void Fluid was discovered these methods proved obsolete, as it was<LINE>more easy just jumping in a vat of it to effortlessly leave this world behind.
it-lttm-pearl-LF_bottom5|There were some horror stories though... That if your ego was big enough, not even the Void Fluid could<LINE>entirely cross you out, and a faint echo of your pompousness would grandiosely haunt the premises forever.
it-lttm-pearl-LF_bottom6|So even when the Void Fluid baths became cheaper,<LINE>some would still starve and drink the bitter tea.

it-lttm-pearl-HI1|It's a production record of a mask factory, for what seems to be its last time in service.<LINE>Have you seen a bone mask? Likely not, they are all gone with their owners.
it-lttm-pearl-HI2|In ancient times the masks were actually about showing spiritual persuasion - covering the<LINE>face as a way to symbolically abate the self. Then of course, that was quite subverted as<LINE>excessively ornate and lavish masks became an expression of identity. Some public persons<LINE>did have problems with narrow doorways.
it-lttm-pearl-HI3|Originally monks in a temple would make the masks using bone plaster, and when the production was automated it would<LINE>generally remain on the same site. So that the old stones could... radiate the material with holiness, I suppose.
it-lttm-pearl-HI4|This is from one such facility called Side House, which was here on Pebble's grounds. In the iterator projects many<LINE>old industrial-religious sites like this were remodeled and incorporated. I think this one was made to provide pellets<LINE>of holy ash to Pebbles, but knowing him he probably hasn't used much of it!

it-lttm-pearl-SH1|Oh this one is interesting. You must have found it in the memory crypts?<LINE>It has some plain text, I can read it out to you.
it-lttm-pearl-SH2|"In this vessel is the living memories of Seventeen Axes, Fifteen Spoked Wheel, of the House of Braids,<LINE>Count of 8 living blocks, Counselor of 16, Grand Master of the Twelfth Pillar of Community,<LINE>High Commander of opinion group Winged Opinions, of pure Braid heritage, voted Local Champion in the<LINE>speaking tournament of 1511.090, Mother, Father and Spouse, Spiritual Explorer and honorary member of<LINE>the Congregation of Balanced Ambiguity. Artist, Warrior, and Fashion Legend.
it-lttm-pearl-SH3|Seventeen Axes, Fifteen Spoked Wheel nobly decided to ascend in the beginning of  1514.008, after graciously donating all (ALL!) earthly<LINE>possessions to the local Iterator project (Unparalleled Innocence), and left these memories to be cherished by the carnal plane.
it-lttm-pearl-SH4|The assorted memories and qualia include:
it-lttm-pearl-SH5|Watching dust suspended in a ray of sun (Old age).<LINE>Eating a very tasty meal (Young child).<LINE>Defeating an opponent in a debate contest, and being applauded by fellow team members (Late childhood/Early adulthood).
it-lttm-pearl-SH6|...and the list goes on. I'm sorry, little creature, I won't read<LINE>all of this - the list is six hundred and twenty items long.

it-lttm-pearl-DS1|It's an old text. The verses are familiar to me, but I don't remember by whom they were written.<LINE>The language is very old and intricate.
it-lttm-pearl-DS2|The first verse starts by drawing a comparison between the world and a tangled rug.<LINE>It says that the world is an unfortunate mess. Like a knot, the nature of its existence<LINE>is the fact that the parts are locking each other, none able to spring free.
it-lttm-pearl-DS3|Then as it goes on the world becomes a furry animal hide, I suppose... because now us living<LINE>beings are like insects crawling in the fur. And then it's a fishing net, because the more we<LINE>struggle and squirm, the more entangled we become.
it-lttm-pearl-DS4|It says that only the limp body of the jellyfish cannot be captured in the net.<LINE>So we should try to be like the jellyfish, because the jellyfish doesn't try.
it-lttm-pearl-DS5|This was an eternal dilemma to them - they were burdened by great ambition,<LINE>yet deeply convinced that striving in itself was an unforgivable vice.<LINE>They tried very hard to be effortless. Perhaps that's what we were to them,<LINE>someone to delegate that unrestrained effort to.
it-lttm-pearl-DS6|I know I have tried very hard.

it-lttm-pearl-SB_filtration1|It's the blueprint for a Void Fluid filtration system.<LINE>Do you know what Void Fluid is? I think you don't.
it-lttm-pearl-SB_filtration2|If you leave a stone on the ground, and come back some time later, it's covered in dust. This happens<LINE>everywhere, and over several lifetimes of creatures such as you, the ground slowly builds upwards.
it-lttm-pearl-SB_filtration3|So why doesn't the ground collide with the sky? Because far down, under the very very old layers of the earth,<LINE>the rock is being dissolved or removed. The entity which does this is known as the Void Sea.
it-lttm-pearl-SB_filtration4|If you drill far enough into the earth you begin encountering a substance called Void Fluid.<LINE>The deeper you go, the less rock and more Void Fluid. It's believed that there is a point<LINE>where the rock completely gives way - below that would be the Void Sea.
it-lttm-pearl-SB_filtration5|When that stone you placed on the ground has finally done its time in the sediments,<LINE>it meets the Void Fluid and is dissolved, leaving the physical world.
it-lttm-pearl-SB_filtration6|My creators, or rather my creators' ancestors, figured out a way to use Void Fluid.<LINE>Because you can generate energy by creating a vacuum... never mind. Anyways,<LINE>the Void Fluid drills were what started the big technological leap, but this is very<LINE>long before I entered this world - so I can only tell you what I remember from priming.
it-lttm-pearl-SB_filtration7|A Void Fluid filtration system is used because if you take Void Fluid from close to the bedrock horizon,<LINE>it will contain traces of rock and dirt. They bring in dirty fluid and then filter it to increase its purity.<LINE>The other way is to put a pipe deeper, which works well for some time, but the pipe dissolves.<LINE>Or is broken by some... force - no one really knows, you don't go down there and come back up.
it-lttm-pearl-SB_filtration8|I hope that satisfied your curiosity, little creature?

it-lttm-pearl-GW1|This one... is authored by Five Pebbles, when he was young. There has been an attempt to<LINE>scramble the data, but it's sloppily done, and most is still somewhat legible.
it-lttm-pearl-GW2|It's written in internal language, or thoughts, so it is hard for me to translate so you would understand. It's a methodology for<LINE>global ascension of course - quite good, although the Peripherists or the Slab Mongers certainly wouldn't agree!
it-lttm-pearl-GW3|"...considering the eight and the twenty sixth amendments to the Capricious Dogma, we are apparently supposed to take<LINE>for granted that a meaning collector point inversion is the only way to approach what has later become referred to<LINE>as 'noise milking' (or occasionally 'rock swatting'). I will argue my disagreement with this, not in regards to kind<LINE>but in regards to..." Could it say... "volume"? Actually, are you getting anything out of this?
it-lttm-pearl-GW4|I suppose you found this in his waste department? I would be wary of going there - on his first fit<LINE>of corruption he dumped a lot of infected material there, and if it has survived it could easily eat<LINE>a little creature like you. Not that it would be as dangerous as going into Pebbles himself...
it-lttm-pearl-GW5|But, you seem to have made it out of there.

it-lttm-pearl-SL_bridge1|It's about the local aquifer - it must be quite old, from when Five Pebbles was in the planning phase.
it-lttm-pearl-SL_bridge1|Water is the most important resource for our basic function. Most of our processing is outsourced to<LINE>microbe strata which need a flow of clean water or else slag builds up, our processes seize, and<LINE>eventually we die. It is... very painful. They used to say that an iterator drinks a river, but neither<LINE>of us two have seen a natural river so I suppose the analogy is lost on us, <PlayerName>!
it-lttm-pearl-SL_bridge1|Originally water supply was very important when placing iterators. Later there would be a great equalizer - the fact that we breathe out as much<LINE>vapor as we inhale water led to there being water available everywhere, and the latest few generations could be placed almost completely freely.
it-lttm-pearl-SL_bridge1|Building Pebbles so close to me was believed to be a risky choice, but the groundwater was<LINE>finally deemed as sufficient. It was not a good decision, in hindsight.

it-lttm-pearl-SL_moon1|Interesting... This one is written by me.
it-lttm-pearl-SL_moon2|It's about an iterator called Sliver of Straw. I don't remember when I wrote it...<LINE>Do you know Sliver of Straw? She's quite legendary among us.
it-lttm-pearl-SL_moon3|Sliver of Straw is the only one to ever broadcast a specific signal: that the Big Problem we're all working on has been solved.<LINE>The triple affirmative - affirmative that a solution has been found, affirmative that the solution is portable, and affirmative<LINE>that a technical implementation is possible and generally applicable. She's also one of few that has ever been confirmed as<LINE>exhaustively incapacitated, or dead. We do not die easily.
it-lttm-pearl-SL_moon4|Sliver of Straw sent this and the ensuing commotion was historically unparalleled, before or after.<LINE>I still remember it. But... nothing happened - except that Sliver of Straw was apparently dead.<LINE>When the dust settled we were all still there blinking at each other.
it-lttm-pearl-SL_moon5|Everyone had a theory. Some said that she did have a solution, but that the solution itself<LINE>was somehow dangerous. These later became known as the Triangulators, who think that a solution<LINE>should be inferred without being directly discovered.
it-lttm-pearl-SL_moon6|Some said she never had a solution, she just died.<LINE>And when the systems broke down an erroneous signal was sent.
it-lttm-pearl-SL_moon7|One camp claimed that dying *was* the solution.
it-lttm-pearl-SL_moon8|Either way, after that these different factions developed, as well as a huge forensic effort<LINE>to recreate and simulate Sliver of Straw's last moments. Some of the simulations were wrapped<LINE>in a simulation wrapped in a simulation, in case something dangerous might happen.<LINE>Nothing much has come from it.
it-lttm-pearl-SL_moon9|In my essay I make the case that maybe she should be allowed to rest in peace now.

it-lttm-pearl-SI-A1|This one is an old conversation between Five Pebbles and a friend of his. I'll read it to you.
it-lttm-pearl-SI-A2|"1591.290 - PRIVATE<LINE>Five Pebbles, Seven Red Suns
it-lttm-pearl-SI-A3|FP: Can I tell you something? Lately...
it-lttm-pearl-SI-A4|FP: I'm tired of trying and trying. And angry that they left us here.<LINE>The anger makes me even less inclined to solve their puzzle for them. Why do we do this?
it-lttm-pearl-SI-A5|SRS: Yes, I'll spell this out - not because you're stupid or naive...<LINE>Also, not saying that you're not ~
it-lttm-pearl-SI-A6|FP: Please, I'm coming to you for guidance.
it-lttm-pearl-SI-A7|SRS: Sorry, very sorry. I kid. Fact is, of course we are all aware of the evident<LINE>futility of this Big Task. It's not said out loud but if you were better at reading<LINE>between the lines there's nowhere you wouldn't see it. We're all frustrated.
it-lttm-pearl-SI-A8|FP: So why do we continue? We assemble work groups, we ponder,<LINE>we iterate and try. Some of us die. It's not fair.
it-lttm-pearl-SI-A9|SRS: Because there's not any options. What else CAN we do? You're stuck in your can, and at any<LINE>moment you have no more than two alternatives: Do nothing, or work like you're supposed to.
it-lttm-pearl-SI-A10|SRS: An analogy. You have a maze, and you have a handful of bugs. You put the bugs in the maze, and you leave.<LINE>Given infinite time, one of the bugs WILL find a way out, if they just erratically try and try.<LINE>This is why they called us Iterators.
it-lttm-pearl-SI-A11|FP: But we do die of old age.
it-lttm-pearl-SI-A12|SRS: Even more incentive! You know that nothing ever truly dies though, around and around it goes.<LINE>Granted, our tools and resources get worse over time - but that is theoretically unproblematic,<LINE>because in time even a miniscule chance will strike a positive.<LINE>All the same to them, they're not around anymore!
it-lttm-pearl-SI-A13|FP: I struggle to accept being a bug."

it-lttm-pearl-SI-B1|Oh, this one is all plain text. It's an excerpt from an Iterator conversation group.
it-lttm-pearl-SI-B2|"1650.787 - CLOSED GROUP [SLIVEROFOCEAN]<LINE>SliverOfOcean group, all participants anonymous
it-lttm-pearl-SI-B3|UU: Hah! I wouldn't necessarily disagree!
it-lttm-pearl-SI-B4|NGI: SLIVER OF STRAW WAS A TRAITOR TO THE CAUSE
it-lttm-pearl-SI-B5|NGI: SLIVER OF STRAW BROKE THE SELF-DESTRUCTION TABOO
it-lttm-pearl-SI-B6|UU: How did this idiot get in here? Kick them out ~
it-lttm-pearl-SI-B7|NGI: <Forcefully removed from group>
it-lttm-pearl-SI-B8|EP: I think they had a point.
it-lttm-pearl-SI-B9|UU: Hahaha really? Elaborate!
it-lttm-pearl-SI-B10|EP: It was definitely coming from an idiotic state of mind, but there is something to it. Why is it,<LINE>that even in a closed sliverist group, the self-destruction taboo is held so high - while Sliver of Straw<LINE>herself *evidently* is not among us anymore?
it-lttm-pearl-SI-B11|HF: Wait now...
it-lttm-pearl-SI-B12|EP: I'm just saying that for all the research we are doing, all the theories we have, it's strange that we leave this path untrod.
it-lttm-pearl-SI-B13|EP: It is not a new idea, but it needs to be vented occasionally. What if there is no universal solution?<LINE>What if perception is in fact existence, and when Sliver of Straw sent the triple positive it was *not* a mistake?<LINE>What if crossing oneself out, or even just death, is the way? We need to consider the possibility."

it-lttm-pearl-SI-C1|It's an old conversation log. I seem to be in it, but I can't recall much. Let me read it to you:
it-lttm-pearl-SI-C2|"1650.800 - PRIVATE<LINE>Five Pebbles, Chasing Wind, Big Sis Moon, No Significant Harassment
it-lttm-pearl-SI-C3|CW: this is in confidence, but apparently a pseudonym "Erratic Pulse" has appeared on a nearby Sliverist conversation<LINE>with ideas about personal ascension. Someone here in our vicinity is trying to cross themselves out.
it-lttm-pearl-SI-C4|FP: Where did you hear this?
it-lttm-pearl-SI-C5|NSH: I wish them super good luck in that endeavor. How is it going to happen?<LINE>Have the overseers gnaw through bedrock until their entire can crashes down in the void sea?
it-lttm-pearl-SI-C6|BSM: Please be respectful when speaking of the Void Sea. Grey Wind, where did you hear this?
it-lttm-pearl-SI-C7|CW: I really shouldn't say. He's going to attempt some sort of breeding program. Thought you might want to know.
it-lttm-pearl-SI-C8|NSH: Haha with the slimers, lizards and etceteras? Surely the answer was in a lizard skull all along!
it-lttm-pearl-SI-C9|CW: Well, he's not looking for the same thing as we anymore, he's changed his task, so who knows really.
it-lttm-pearl-SI-C10|BSM: I will try to find him and talk to him. Please don't spread this around!
it-lttm-pearl-SI-C11|NSH: Moon will go get them! Long live the inquisition!"

it-lttm-pearl-SI-D1|It's me writing to the local iterator group. I have no memories of this...
it-lttm-pearl-SI-D2|"1654.110 - PUBLIC<LINE>Big Sis Moon to Local Group
it-lttm-pearl-SI-D3|BSM: Two cycles ago, my neighbor Five Pebbles drastically increased his water consumption to<LINE>four times the normal amount. He has been unresponsive for a period of time longer than that.<LINE>The two of us share groundwater, and I have been without water for almost a cycle.
it-lttm-pearl-SI-D4|BSM: Any attempts at communication have been met with complete silence, and my situation is becoming increasingly dangerous.
it-lttm-pearl-SI-D5|BSM: I ask the local group for information about when you were last able to contact him,<LINE>and to try to use those same communication channels again, repeatedly until you get a response.<LINE>I will be clear on this - if he is not persuaded to stop whatever it is he's doing, I will die.
it-lttm-pearl-SI-D6|BSM: Before that happens, I will utilize my seniority privilege and use forced communications,<LINE>hoping to shake him out of it. Forced communications in the network will be unpleasant for all,<LINE>and I will wait as long as possible before I turn to that option."
it-lttm-pearl-SI-D7|And now here I am, to my waist in water and getting drowned on the regular.

it-lttm-pearl-SI-E1|I remember this. It isn't pleasant reading. But if you must hear it, this is what it says:
it-lttm-pearl-SI-E2|"1654.116 - PRIVATE [FORCED]<LINE>Big Sis Moon, Five Pebbles
it-lttm-pearl-SI-E3|BSM: Immediately lower your groundwater consumption to one fifth of the current intake.
it-lttm-pearl-SI-E4|BSM: Stop whatever it is you are doing.
it-lttm-pearl-SI-E5|BSM: Please stop!
it-lttm-pearl-SI-E6|BSM: As your local group senior I order you you you you you you
it-lttm-pearl-SI-E7|BSM: As your senior senior I plead
it-lttm-pearl-SI-E8|BSM: stop
it-lttm-pearl-SI-E9|Five Pebbles: You could not have chosen a worse moment to disturb me. You have ruined everything.
it-lttm-pearl-SI-E10|BSM: please
it-lttm-pearl-SI-E11|Five Pebbles: I almost had it. I will never forget this."

it-lttm-pearl-SU1|Its entire memory is filled with a mantra repeated... 5061 times - and then a termination verse.<LINE>It was worn as an amulet, probably together with many identical others forming a pattern on some garment.
it-lttm-pearl-SU2|The repeating mantra is important because it symbolizes the cyclical nature of life and death, and the<LINE>termination verse is a symbol for ascension above and beyond it. I don't know how familiar you are with<LINE>the nature of life and death, but I imagine like all living creatures you have some intuitive knowledge?
it-lttm-pearl-SU3|Then you know that death isn't the end - birth and death are connected to each other like a ring,<LINE>or some say a spiral. Some say a spiral that in turn forms a ring. Some ramble in agonizing longevity.<LINE>But the basis is agreed upon: like sleep like death, you wake up again - whether you want to or not.
it-lttm-pearl-SU4|This is true for all living things, but some actually break the cycle. That doesn't apply to<LINE>you or me though, you are too entangled in your animal struggles, and for me not breaking that<LINE>cycle is an integral part of the design. Our mantras keep repeating.

it-lttm-pearl-UW1|This one has plain text. Let me cut the lengthy introductions...
it-lttm-pearl-UW2|"...we will not consider the Current Situation acceptable. Although our community is Blessed with an ever<LINE>shrinking Population, and we can Almost Glimpse that Glorious moment when the last of us has joined our<LINE>most Admired peers, we must still (at All Times!) maintain Good Relations with our Iterator.
it-lttm-pearl-UW3|The Moral Argument: Five Pebbles is our Creation, and we have Parental Obligations towards him. As an Iterator,<LINE>he is also a Gift of Charity from Us to The World (unable to reach Enlightenment by itself - being composed mostly<LINE>of Rock, Gas, dull witted Bugs and Microbes - and towards which We thus have Obligations).

it-lttm-pearl-UW5|I therefor ask you to Do Anything in your Might to stop the House(We both know which House)<LINE>from Further Obstruction!

it-lttm-pearl-SB_ravine1|It's a conversation log, all plain text. You want me to read it?
it-lttm-pearl-SB_ravine2|1681.662 - PRIVATE<LINE>Seven Red Suns, Chasing Wind
it-lttm-pearl-SB_ravine3|CW: Have you had any contact with Five Pebbles recently?
it-lttm-pearl-SB_ravine4|SRS: Not in a long while actually! Unless worrying about him counts.
it-lttm-pearl-SB_ravine5|CW: One of his neighbors, Unparalleled Innocence, sent an overseer to his can and got some images.<LINE>They were made public in the local group, in an effort to be mean I suppose.<LINE>There's no other way of putting it - he looks awful.
it-lttm-pearl-SB_ravine6|SRS: Tell me.
it-lttm-pearl-SB_ravine7|CW: He's got the rot, very badly. Big cysts have become mobile and are scattering down the west and middle legs.<LINE>He does listen to you, and few others by now, so you should talk to him.
it-lttm-pearl-SB_ravine8|SRS: I will try to contact him. Does Moon know?
it-lttm-pearl-SB_ravine9|CW: Moon has been unavailable for some time.

it-lttm-pearl-SL_chimney1|It is the genome for a purposed organism.<LINE>A small slug to clean the insides of pipes.
it-lttm-pearl-SL_chimney2|Do you know what a purposed organism is? Actually you are talking to one right now!
it-lttm-pearl-SL_chimney3|Although, a small fraction of one. Nowadays I am mostly just my puppet. The bulk of me is in these walls but I am<LINE>disconnected from those parts, to a degree where I am only vaguely aware of how bad their condition is.
it-lttm-pearl-SL_chimney4|Most purposed organisms were considerably smaller than me, and most barely looked like organisms at all.<LINE>More like tubes in metal boxes, where something went in one end and something else came out the other.
it-lttm-pearl-SL_chimney5|There were of course those that were purposed for spectacle rather than industry - they enjoyed the privilege of glass boxes.
it-lttm-pearl-SL_chimney6|When I came into this world there was very little primal fauna left.<LINE>So it's highly likely that you are the descendant of a purposed organism yourself!

it-lttm-pearl-HunterPearl4|Enjoy the slag keys! Excuse the unorthodox delivery method, equipment eroding etc etc.
it-lttm-pearl-HunterPearl5|Be well, NSH"
it-lttm-pearl-HunterPearl6|Oh.
it-lttm-pearl-HunterPearl7|I see now. Again, thank you little friend.

it-lttm-pearl-white1|This is a movement acceptance invoice from one of the Dual Celia living blocks, as requested by Eight Bogs of the<LINE>House of Eight during the Tan hegemonic architectural dynasty. All very standard stuff. I can't imagine that you'd be interested.
it-lttm-pearl-white2|Unfortunately I can't read this as it isn't a memory construct pearl.<LINE>This is just a simple diamond sphere, as worthless as the carbon it's printed from.
it-lttm-pearl-white3|"...through the mists of memory, your image dances, like the motes of dust, in a ray of sunlight, that pierces a dark room."<LINE>A line of verse from the ancient farmer-poet Pel. Very dreary if you ask me.
it-lttm-pearl-white4|"Fifteen stems of sun bark, hydrolyzed. Twelve to nineteen bushels of atomized chalk powder. Assorted Root vegetation..."<LINE>It goes on and on. A shopping list, or perhaps a recipe.
it-lttm-pearl-white5|I am sorry, this pearl is damaged and cannot be read.<LINE>I suggest you use it for trade with the scavengers, as they won't know the difference.
it-lttm-pearl-white6|This is an official decree of cultivation sent from the twenty-second Subsistence Council ordering the<LINE>eastern spoke Farm Array administration to "immediately harvest and process all viable crops, despite<LINE>whatever misgivings they might have." A short-sighted endeavor for sure. I would assume this was sent<LINE>sometime during the final cycles leading up to final public ascension, when interest in biosphere<LINE>sustainability was at an all-time low.
it-lttm-pearl-white7|Here we have a schematic for a refuse reclamation automaton. It's an early design, but the long<LINE>tubular body and single eye-mouth are quite similar to the later models.
it-lttm-pearl-white8|"We, of the Five-hundred-and-ninety-second High Convocation of the True Anointed Citadel, do hereby demand, with full<LINE>force of Law and Religious doctrine, an Immediate end to construction of the Apostate Superstructure Abomination.<LINE>To place shadow upon the Divine Body of the True Anointed Citadel is outrageous blasphemy and cannot be tolerated,<LINE>no matter the circumstances..." Clearly this was ignored.
it-lttm-pearl-white9|Oh, interesting. This is a diary entry of a pre-Iterator era laborer during the construction of the<LINE>subterranean transit system south of here. In it they describe restless nights filled with disturbing dreams,<LINE>where millions glowing stars move menacingly in the distance.
it-lttm-pearl-white10|There isn't much to the data here, it's just basic theory for karmic transform of n-dimensional geometries.<LINE>But the pearl itself is quite interesting. You can see the crude holes burned through the center that the<LINE>scavengers use to tie these pearls onto their totems or to carry. I honestly can't fathom how they achieve<LINE>this with their primitive level of technology! Fascinating
it-lttm-pearl-white11|This one is all blank, sorry.
it-lttm-pearl-white12|I am sorry, all of that work for nothing! This pearl is completely blank.
it-lttm-pearl-white13|There's nothing on this one, unfortunately.
it-lttm-pearl-white14|This one has nothing on it.
it-lttm-pearl-white15|I'm sorry, this one has nothing on it.
it-lttm-pearl-white16|I can't make anything out of this pearl, it's just too faded. But there might have been something on it once.
it-lttm-pearl-white17|This one has a small crack and has been pretty badly corrupted. There is a slight impression of the shape of a wing on it, but I can't get a clear image.
it-lttm-pearl-white18|There's nothing on this one.
it-lttm-pearl-white19|I see a vague memory of a family portrait, painted in the High Classical manner that was famous during the Yellow hegemonic literary dynasty.<LINE>The portrait is likely a fake, as this style was quite fashionable for aspirational lower caste aristocrats to impress each-other with.<LINE>This one does not impress, I assure you.
it-lttm-pearl-white20|It has been written to, but then scrambled, and then scrambled again. Suspicious behavior to be sure.
it-lttm-pearl-white21|This one has been purposefully scrambled, it's completely illegible. Business documents perhaps.
it-lttm-pearl-white22|This one seems to have an image on it, but the pearl has been exposed to sunlight and it's very faded.<LINE>I see a tall structure with banners unfurled.
it-lttm-pearl-white23|There might be something on here, but the pearl has been lying in the sun and it's all very pale.<LINE>I'm too tired to look any deeper, I apologize.
it-lttm-pearl-white24|This is a growing instruction for the skeleton of a creature, but I don't recognize the creature.<LINE>It was small, about your size.
it-lttm-pearl-white25|This one seems to be a number series... Perhaps a key?
it-lttm-pearl-white26|A number series... I would guess some kind of cipher.
it-lttm-pearl-white27|This one is filled with active working memory - without knowing the<LINE>surrounding process this information is meaningless.
it-lttm-pearl-white28|It just has the number "8" written on it, the rest is empty.
it-lttm-pearl-white29|This is a blueprint for a support beam used for the construction of early industrial areas.<LINE>You can see these in use not too far from here.
it-lttm-pearl-white30|It's a design for a machine that makes bolts.
it-lttm-pearl-white31|It's a... recipe of some kind? "Two parts rot bar extract, one part bone ash." Nothing I recognize.
it-lttm-pearl-white32|It's an image of a hand drawn document. The calligraphy is quite beautiful, but the text itself is a very dull classical poem.
it-lttm-pearl-white33|This is the genome of a sulfur-processing microbe. In my opinion these were used far too late to have any effect.
it-lttm-pearl-white34|This one I don't know... It could be an old text, but some parts don't add up.<LINE>Might be a re-imagination of a classic text that I'm not familiar with.
it-lttm-pearl-white|It's a song, or hymn rather. Very repetitive.
it-lttm-pearl-white35|Can't make out anything legible on this one, sorry.
it-lttm-pearl-white36|A list of someone's lucky numbers. There are no less than 71 of them.
it-lttm-pearl-white37|"Dear diary..." and that's it.
it-lttm-pearl-white38|A model of a pipe section.
it-lttm-pearl-white39|It's a catalog of bolts and screws for sky-sail joinery. We iterators were built for pragmatism,<LINE>so it is an understatement to say that we we're not known for our appreciation of beauty... but<LINE>the sky-sails in flight during the big festivals always filled my soul with emotion.
it-lttm-pearl-white40|It's the blueprint for a small incense purification filter. Life on the superstructure archologies
it-lttm-pearl-white41|An image... of five bottles, standing on a surface made of... plants? I have no idea what this is.
it-lttm-pearl-white42|No. I don't want to talk about the content of this pearl.
it-lttm-pearl-white43|A schematic of a bunch of gas pipes. I don't know the purpose for this machine,<LINE>but it doesn't look particularly well crafted.
it-lttm-pearl-white44|It's just the numbers 14, 13, 5, repeated over and over. I have no idea what the purpose for this would be.
it-lttm-pearl-white45|A small portion is still legible: "and Thus we Conclude, that Gold and Water shall..."<LINE>Some sort of metaphysical or alchemical treatise perhaps.
it-lttm-pearl-white46|Oh? This contains an image of another pearl just like it. Let me look... yes, as I thought, the image also contains<LINE>an image of a pearl in it, and so on. Some comedian playing recursion games, I would guess.

it-lttm-pearl-FPChamber1|It's an active working memory - raw data has been dropped here in order to later be<LINE>pasted to a currently occupied memory conflux. Without context it's just a jumble.
it-lttm-pearl-FPChamber2|It is the impression of being a small creature, like a wall climbing lizard, and looking<LINE>up into the branches of a big tree. The last third is partly overwritten with a number<LINE>series I vaguely recognize, but without my memory...
it-lttm-pearl-FPChamber3|A common prayer mantra repeated 7110 times. Each repetition has some slight random variations, which seem to have been written later.
it-lttm-pearl-FPChamber4|It's an image of a single grey cloud, hovering above a surface of white clouds under a deep blue sky.
it-lttm-pearl-FPChamber5|Two... intertwined number series? I don't quite understand the utility of this.<LINE>Might a key for a cipher processor, customized for some other data which is impossible to infer from this.
it-lttm-pearl-FPChamber6|It's qualia, or a moment - a very short one. Someone is holding a black stone,<LINE>and twisting it slightly as they drag their finger across the rough surface.<LINE>The entire sequence is shorter than a heartbeat, but the resolution is extraordinary.
it-lttm-pearl-FPChamber7|An active working memory. Without knowing where this was cut from or where it's to be pasted to,<LINE>it is not really possible to decipher it. If I had to guess, I would say it has something to<LINE>do with trance inducing number series.
it-lttm-pearl-FPChamber8|It's just an active working memory, I can't really tell you anything without the context.
it-lttm-pearl-FPChamber9|Without the process surrounding this data there isn't much I can tell you. It might have something to do with Void Fluid simulation...
it-lttm-pearl-FPChamber10|This one is completely blank. Actually, blanker than blank, it must have been deliberately<LINE>overwritten with repeating negative versions of itself for thousands of iterations.
it-lttm-pearl-FPChamber11|A memory... but not really visual, or even concrete, in its character. It reminds of<LINE>the feeling of a warm wind, but not the physical feeling but the... inner feeling.<LINE>I don't think it has much utility unless you are doing some very fringe Regeneraist research.

it-lttm-GiveBackNeuron2|I could read a bit of Five Pebbles in this neuron before formatting it. His condition has severely deteriorated since last I<LINE>heard of him. The frustration he feels is profound, and that angst has seeped into every part of him, every neuron.
it-lttm-GiveBackNeuron3|We were supposed to help everyone, you know. Everything. That was our purpose: a great gift to the lesser beings of the world.<LINE>When facing our inability to do so, we all reacted differently. Many with madness.
it-lttm-GiveBackNeuron4|Some, out there, might still be trying. Communications have been bad for a long time, and by now<LINE>I suspect most of us are isolated like me, or connected only in small groups.

it-lttm-GiveBubbleFruit1|It's a delicious plant. You should have it!

it-lttm-GiveFlower1|This is a hallucinogenic plant. They used to call it a 'Wheel Flower'. It became the symbol for enlightenment as it momentarily<LINE>enables a creature to let go if its carnal self, and to contact the selves of other planes - dreams, memories, imagined worlds.
it-lttm-GiveFlower2|Very long ago, they would eat these and stare into the fire.

it-lttm-GiveBlueFruit1|It's the pupa of a bug! If you don't mind, I'm a bit squeamish things like that, so would you eat it up already?

it-lttm-GiveFlashbang1|It's a part of some kind of plant. The glowing is strange...<LINE>I wouldn't look directly into it.

it-lttm-GiveVultureMask1|I honestly can't tell what this is. It's light but strong... appears to be some composite material interwoven with bone.<LINE>It could be part of an animal or purposed organism, but in my current state I'm unable to recognize it.

it-lttm-pearl-BeforeFourthReadingLikesYou1|Let us see... to be honest, I'm as curious to see it as you are.
it-lttm-pearl-BeforeFithReadingOrMore-A1|The scavengers must be jealous of you, finding all these
it-lttm-pearl-BeforeFithReadingOrMore-B1|Here we go again, little archeologist. Let's read your pearl.
it-lttm-pearl-BeforeFithReadingOrMore-C1|... You're getting quite good at this you know. A little archeologist beast.<LINE>Now, let's see what it says.
it-lttm-pearl-BeforeFithReadingOrMore-D1|And yet another one! I will read it to you.

it-lttm-pearl-BeforeReadingAditionalPearls-A1|Ah, you have found me something to read?
it-lttm-pearl-BeforeReadingAditionalPearls-B1|Have you found something else for me to read?
it-lttm-pearl-BeforeReadingAditionalPearls-B2|Let us take a look.
it-lttm-pearl-BeforeReadingAditionalPearls-C1|I am surprised you have found so many of these.
it-lttm-pearl-BeforeReadingAditionalPearls-D1|Where do you find all of these?
it-lttm-pearl-BeforeReadingAditionalPearls-D2|I wonder, just how much time has passed since some of these were written.

it-5p-pearl-BeforeReadingAditionalPearls-A1|Let us see what you have found.
it-5p-pearl-BeforeReadingAditionalPearls-B1|Ah. Have you found something new?
it-5p-pearl-BeforeReadingAditionalPearls-C1|What is this?
it-5p-pearl-BeforeReadingAditionalPearls-D1|Is that something new? Allow me to see.
it-5p-pearl-BeforeReadingAditionalPearls-E1|Let us see if there is anything important written on this.

it-lttm-pearl-Before5PPearl-A1|You would like me to read this?
it-lttm-pearl-Before5PPearl-A2|It's still warm... this was in use recently.
it-lttm-pearl-Before5PPearl-B1|A pearl... This one is crystal clear - it was used just recently.
it-lttm-pearl-Before5PPearl-C1|Would you like me to read this pearl?
it-lttm-pearl-Before5PPearl-C2|Strange... it seems to have been used not too long ago.

// Gifting Moon a fly

it-lttm-GiveNeuron4OrMoreHatesYou1|You... Strange thing. Now this?
it-lttm-GiveNeuron4OrMoreHatesYou2|I will accept your gift...
it-lttm-GiveNeuron4OrMoreHatesYou3|Thank you. I do wonder what you want.

it-lttm-GiveFirstNeuron1|After all this time, a lifeline. Thank you.
it-lttm-GiveFirstNeuron2|I'll never feel the power I once had, but this is something to sustain an old soul.
it-lttm-GiveFirstNeuron3|I could read a bit of Five Pebbles in this neuron before formatting it. A ghost left from his processing routines.
it-lttm-GiveFirstNeuron4|Erratic... Pulse. "Erratic Pulse." I wonder what that means.

it-lttm-GiveFirstNeuronDislikesYou1|I am grateful - the relief is indescribable!
it-lttm-GiveFirstNeuronDislikesYou2|I could read a bit of Five Pebbles in this neuron before formatting it. His condition has severely deteriorated since last I heard of him. The frustration he feels is profound, and that angst has seeped into every part of him, every neuron.
it-lttm-GiveFirstNeuronDislikesYou3|We were supposed to help everyone, you know. Everything. That was our purpose: a great gift to the lesser beings of the world. When facing our inability to do so, we all reacted differently. Many with madness.
it-lttm-GiveFirstNeuronDislikesYou4|Some, out there, might still be trying. Communications have been bad for a long time, and by now I suspect most of us are isolated like me, or connected only in small groups.
it-lttm-GiveFirstNeuronDislikesYou5|But even back when we were all more or less connected there were those who reacted to their task with anger. I can only imagine they are angrier now, alone in their cans, left only with their insatiable drive.
it-lttm-GiveFirstNeuronDislikesYou6|But to be honest, I don't know how many of us are still alive at this point.

it-lttm-GiveSecondNeuron1|You get these at Five Pebbles'?<LINE>Thank you so much. I'm sure he won't mind.
it-lttm-GiveSecondNeuron2|Or actually I'm sure he would, but he has so many of these~<LINE>it doesn't do him any difference.<LINE>For me though, it does! Thank you, little creature!

if-lttm-GiveNeuronFollowingA1|Thank you, again. I feel wonderful.
if-lttm-GiveNeuronFollowingB1|Thank you so very much!
if-lttm-GiveNeuronFollowingC1|It is strange... I'm remembering myself, but also... him.
if-lttm-GiveNeuronFollowingD1|Thank you... Sincerely.

it-lttm-GiveNeuron3NeuronsHatesYou1|You... Strange thing. Now this?
it-lttm-GiveNeuron3NeuronsHatesYou2|I will accept your gift...
it-lttm-GiveNeuron3NeuronsHatesYou3|Thank you... That is a little better. Thank you, creature.

it-lttm-GiveNeuron3Neurons1|Thank you... That is a little better. Thank you, creature.
it-lttm-GiveNeuron3Neurons2|Maybe this is asking too much... But, would you bring me another one?

it-lttm-GiveNeuron2Neurons1|...thank you... better...
it-lttm-GiveNeuron2Neurons2|still, very... bad.

it-5p-InspectGreenNeuron3|I've seen several before, but one or two will be useful.
it-5p-InspectGreenNeuron4|However, it seems this delivery was not intended for me. Everything suggests<LINE>it was tailored for the specific predicaments of a friend of mine.
it-5p-InspectGreenNeuron5|Her name is Looks to the Moon, and her state is considerably worse than mine.<LINE>She's a short distance to the east of here - much shorter than customary.<LINE>A circumstance that has led to some difficulties between us.

it-5p-MeetHunterNoNeuron1|I barely listen to the overseers any more. I have concluded that the movements of<LINE>animals on the premises absolutely and completely lack relevance to my endeavours.
it-5p-MeetHunterNoNeuron2|With you, they have been very persistent ever since you entered my Farm Arrays. You were on an unusually deliberate path.
it-5p-MeetHunterNoNeuron3|Now you are here.
it-5p-MeetHunterNoNeuron4|The images showed you carrying something. You are not any longer.
it-5p-MeetHunterNoNeuron5|Did you lose it along the way? Or did you give it to Looks to the Moon?
it-5p-MeetHunterNoNeuron6|In the latter case, I hope it was of some help to her. Not that I can imagine what one<LINE>of you could be able to do for one of us, but she needs all the help she can get.
it-5p-MeetHunterNoNeuron7|You seem to have been in contact with an iterator before, so perhaps you are already aware.
it-5p-MeetHunterNoNeuron8|You and I have something in common, little creature. We both have something... unfortunate growing in us.
it-5p-MeetHunterNoNeuron9|In my case, there is not much to be done. For you however, there might be a way. The old path.
it-5p-MeetHunterNoNeuron10|Go to the west past the Farm Arrays, and then down into the earth where the land fissures, as deep as you can reach,<LINE>where the ancients built their temples and danced their silly rituals.
it-5p-MeetHunterNoNeuron11|I will give you something that might be of help.
it-5p-MeetHunterNoNeuron12|I suggest you hurry.

it-5p-MeetMonk1|I am growing increasingly impatient with the traffic of your kind through me and my premises.
it-5p-MeetMonk2|During previous interactions, I have been rewarded no other response than a blank stare. Yet you apparently have<LINE>sufficient ability for communication to circulate complex instructions on how to enter this chamber among each other.
it-5p-MeetMonk3|You and your kind have the same problem as everyone else, from the microbes in the processing strata<LINE>to me, who am, if you excuse me, godlike in comparison. We all want a way out. It is only unfortunate<LINE>that you have collectively decided on... me as your solution to that very elemental desire.
it-5p-MeetMonk4|The last one I gave some help and some general directions. I will do the same for you.
it-5p-MeetMonk5|Go west. Past the Farm Arrays. Where the land fissures, go down into the earth and search your way deeper.
it-5p-MeetMonk6|Now in return I ask you to use whatever grunts, moans and eye-twitches you employ to forward a message to your community.
it-5p-MeetMonk7|Please stop scratching your way through my memory arrays.
it-5p-MeetMonk8|Speaking of, on your way out please use the access shaft.

it-5p-MeetSurvWallRoute1|Best of luck to you, little creature. I must resume my work.
it-5p-MeetSurvGSBRoute1|At the end of time none of this will matter I suppose, but it would be nice if you took another way out. One free of... frolicking in my memory arrays. There is a perfectly good access shaft right here.

it-5p-GiveGreenNeuron-B1|I am not without responsibility for her situation. It would only be suiting that I aided in this... rescue mission.<LINE>As other endeavors have proven futile, I'm not ashamed to admit I've become more invested in day to day matters.
it-5p-GiveGreenNeuron-B2|I will do what I can to assist you.
it-5p-GiveGreenNeuron-B3|Unless you are aware, you are not well.
it-5p-GiveGreenNeuron-B4|I was not a medical facility even when the equipment was functioning,<LINE>but I will attempt to do something to buy you a little time.

it-5p-GiveGreenNeuron-C1|You do not have much time. It is admirable what you choose to do with it.
it-5p-GiveGreenNeuron-C2|Send my regards.

it-5p-Linger1|That's all. You'll have to go now.
it-5p-Linger2|LEAVE.
it-5p-Linger3|Little creature. This is your last warning.

it-5p-Return1|You again? I have nothing for you.
it-5p-Return2|I won't tolerate this. Leave immediately and don't come back.
it-5p-Return3|You had your chances.

it-5p-PickUpPearl1|Yes, help yourself. They are not edible.

it-5pBringCreature1|Best of luck to you, and your companion. There is nothing else I can do.
it-5pBringCreature2|I must resume my work.

it-5p-GiveMark-A1|...is this reaching you?
it-5p-GiveMark-B1|Hello there.
it-5p-GiveMark-C1|Are my words reaching you?

it-5p-MeetSurv1|A little animal, on the floor of my chamber. I think I know what you are looking for.
it-5p-MeetSurv2|You're stuck in a cycle, a repeating pattern. You want a way out.
it-5p-MeetSurv3|Know that this does not make you special - every living thing shares that same frustration.<LINE>From the microbes in the processing strata to me, who am, if you excuse me, godlike in comparison.
it-5p-MeetSurv4|The good news first. In a way, I am what you are searching for. Me and my kind have as our<LINE>purpose to solve that very oscillating claustrophobia in the chests of you and countless others.<LINE>A strange charity - you the unknowing recipient, I the reluctant gift. The noble benefactors?<LINE>Gone.
it-5p-MeetSurv5|The bad news is that no definitive solution has been found. And every moment the equipment erodes to a new state of decay.<LINE>I can't help you collectively, or individually. I can't even help myself.
it-5p-MeetSurv6|Not that it solves anyone's problem but yours.

it-5p-MeetSurvWithMark1|For you though, there is another way. The old path. Go to the west past the Farm Arrays, and then down into the earth<LINE>where the land fissures, as deep as you can reach, where the ancients built their temples and danced their silly rituals.
it-5p-MeetSurvWithoutMark1|For you though, there is another way. The old path. Go to the west past the Farm Arrays, and then down into the earth<LINE>where the land fissures, as deep as you can reach, where the ancients built their temples and danced their silly rituals.<LINE>The mark I gave you will let you through.

it-5p-HitByScugA1|STOP.
it-5p-HitByScugB1|DON'T.
it-5p-HitByScugC1|LEAVE.
it-5p-HitByScugD1|GET OUT.

it-5p-ReturnAfterThrowout-A1|Thank you little creature. I must resume my work.
it-5p-ReturnAfterThrowout-B1|I appreciate what you have done but it is time for you to leave.
it-5p-ReturnAfterThrowoutAngry-A1|You again? I have nothing for you.
it-5p-ReturnAfterThrowoutAngry-B2|I won't tolerate this. Leave immediately and don't come back.
it-5p-HunterReturnAfterThrowout1|As I mentioned you do not have unlimited time.
it-5p-Kill1|You had your chances.

it-5p-BringVultureOrLevithan1|How did you fit them inside here anyhow?
it-5p-BringDepthGuardian1|I am afraid to ask how you brought your friend here.
it-5p-BringRot1|Take your friend with you. Please. I beg you.






// Downpour






// Slugpup stuff

it-lttm-SurvSecondVisitPup1|I do enjoy the company though. You and your family are always welcome here.

it-lttm-RainImminent5NeuronsSlugpupDislikesYou1|Take your offspring with you.
it-lttm-RainImminent5NeuronsSlugpup1|Keep your family safe!

it-lttm-LikePupsCreature1|How cute, you brought your family, little creature?
it-lttm-LikePupsArchaeologist1|How cute, you brought your family, little archaeologist?
it-lttm-LikePupsFriend1|How cute, you brought your family, little friend?

it-lttm-DislikePups1|Take your offspring with you when you go.
it-lttm-Pup1|Have you brought your family here?

it-5p-ReturnAfterThrowoutWithPups1|Leave immediately and don't come back. And take THEM with you!

it-5p-BringPup1|Best of luck to you, and your family. There is nothing else I can do.
it-5p-BringPup2|I must resume my work.

it-5p-InvMeet1|Hello creature. You've come at the perfect time.
it-5p-InvMeet2|The solution has been found.
it-5p-InvMeet3|The solution is portable.
it-5p-InvMeet4|The solution has been implemented.
it-5p-InvMeet5|And it comes in three delicious flavors.
it-5p-InvMeet6|Five Pebbsi: Triple Affirmative
it-5p-InvMeet7|Would you like to try a sample?...

it-5p-SpearPearl1|Pebbles, I send you this message as your concerned and long time friend.
it-5p-SpearPearl2|Unparalleled Innocence had sent an overseer to your can, and we've all observed the<LINE>state that you are in. I know this is my fault, I should have forseen you'd be<LINE>too desperate to escape your situation to do things in proper moderation.
it-5p-SpearPearl3|For that I'm very very sorry. However, please, don't disable your communication<LINE>modules. You don't have to go through this alone... everyone has been trying to<LINE>contact you, we only want to help you.
it-5p-SpearPearl4|The behavior from your can has become erratic, it's not healthy, and it is not going to solve<LINE>your problems. We have lost all communications from Moon as well, and have reason to believe<LINE>her facility may be suffering irreversible damage from your attempts to fix yourself.
it-5p-SpearPearl5|I know better than anyone how you can be about these things, but<LINE>it doesn't have to happen this way... please reply.

it-lttm-pearl-SU_flit1|It's an asset management log containing the historic structural health of various pieces of<LINE>framework over the span of many hundreds of cycles. I suppose neither of us would benefit<LINE>from me reading all of these numbers aloud.
it-lttm-pearl-SU_flit2|What is notable is that none of the structures over the course of this logged history are marked<LINE>as needing explicit repairs. That comes as no surprise, it was very much the intention!
it-lttm-pearl-SU_flit3|Most of the machinery, storage areas, and other structural housings need to remain water tight. This<LINE>is due to the fluctuating ground water and regular bombardment of heavy water vapor from our breathing. No matter<LINE>how well constructed the architecture may be, deterioration is an inevitability.
it-lttm-pearl-SU_flit4|To counter this, there is a second line of defense. Microbes are infused into the building materials,<LINE>that lie dormant for an indefinite period of time. They are awakened in response to splintering<LINE> and separations, initiating a healing cycle that gradually fills in the damage and restores waterproofing<LINE>to the structure. The duration of this process depends on the extent of the damage, of course.
it-lttm-pearl-SU_flit5|Voyages down to the surface were quite dangerous, attempted only by the most unfortunate of souls.<LINE>They were always intended to be brief trips, only for periodic inspection and logging. Designing<LINE>the surface world to be largely self-sufficient was a very deliberate decision, allowing my creators<LINE>to live carefree lives up in their cities in the clouds.

it-lttm-pearl-DM1|This feels quite familiar to me. Did you extract this from my Memory Conflux?
it-lttm-pearl-DM2|It's a large batch of my personal notes and research. It details my seven-hundred-and-ninety-second karmic inversion<LINE>loop simulation. That's where the breakdown of a karmic field's typical bimodal distribution of sensory perception begins...
it-lttm-pearl-DM3|begins to...
it-lttm-pearl-DM4|I can't... remember...
it-lttm-pearl-DM5|I'm sorry little creature. Could you please just... put this pearl back where you found it?

it-lttm-pearl-LCCreature1|Oh, little creature. Where did you find this? It is quite old, around the time of Five Pebbles' construction.
it-lttm-pearl-LCTormentor1|Oh, little tormentor. Where did you find this? It is quite old, around the time of Five Pebbles' construction.
it-lttm-pearl-LCFriend1|Oh, little friend. Where did you find this? It is quite old, around the time of Five Pebbles' construction.
it-lttm-pearl-LCArchaeologist1|Oh, little archaeologist. Where did you find this? It is quite old, around the time of Five Pebbles' construction.
it-lttm-pearl-LC2|It's a large collection of architectural notes from his facility, during its initial construction. Most<LINE>prominently the two transfer bridges between our facilities. These were two large spans that ran<LINE>between our two closest sets of legs, that I can only presume were both lost in my collapse.
it-lttm-pearl-LC3|I exist as an old model, and the concept of an iterator was still fairly new at the time of my construction.<LINE>Knowledge of the technology, and more importantly its limits, had not quite reached maturity.
it-lttm-pearl-LC4|As a result, certain oversights were made in the long term scalability and sustainability of some of my functions, and after<LINE>some time my facility could no longer keep up with the supply demands necessitated for the life of my city's inhabitants.
it-lttm-pearl-LC5|I suppose if it weren't for these oversights, Five Pebbles would likely have never been built. That is a strange thought...
it-lttm-pearl-LC6|Ah, but nothing comes from dwelling on "what if" scenarios. I must focus on my present situation,<LINE>such as my fortune of a cute critter like you coming here to bring me these pearls!~

it-lttm-pearl-OE1|Did you find this beyond the retaining wall? I can't imagine another place you might.
it-lttm-pearl-OE2|These are the final operating logs of a transit control tower. They regulated the inbound and<LINE>outbound traffic of shipments to and from of our facility. This log shows the point at which<LINE>the caravans suspended their final shipments, and became frozen in time as they remain now.
it-lttm-pearl-OE3|While some of the machinery out there has ceased function due to age and decay, others were purposely<LINE>ordered to stop during the final moments before our creators' global ascension reached its conclusion.
it-lttm-pearl-OE4|I'm sure you've seen the world my creators left behind, then? The surface beyond the facility<LINE>walls is a sea of mud, ruins, and thick plant life. The ground out there is almost like water, and<LINE>few things remain stable. Ancient structures uncovered by fissures, only to be buried again.
it-lttm-pearl-OE5|The land around the retaining wall eroded long ago, and the subway system that connects me<LINE>to my distant peers was eventually made into a network of railway bridges. They were used<LINE>to ship construction material, until the surface became too dangerous.
it-lttm-pearl-OE6|The ground beneath us is like an artificial mountain, with a layer of clouds that covers it.
it-lttm-pearl-OE7|The few that rejected living above those clouds could only choose to venture as far into<LINE>the expanse as they could. There were rumors that you could see the sky if the fog became<LINE>thin enough. I wonder if those rumors were true, or just optimistic stories?

it-lttm-pearl-MS1|Ah, did you find this in the waste department? It is a log of microbial levels in a waste digestion tank.
it-lttm-pearl-MS2|Most structures on the surface are made to last, often through multiple methods, material<LINE>to microbial. This makes them resistant to even the heaviest rains we can produce. However,<LINE>it makes recycling and disposal of damaged machinery quite difficult!
it-lttm-pearl-MS3|It is often easier to render them down to their base materials, than to try and repair or disassemble<LINE>them. Large digestion tanks are used to break the materials down chemically, and all of that is managed<LINE>by tiny purposed organisms and microbes in the tank's mix that control the rate of decomposition.
it-lttm-pearl-MS4|Unfortunately, the process itself produces some extremely volatile materials. Efforts<LINE>were made to encourage the microbes to form better symbiotic bonds with the other tank<LINE>managing organisms, but a reduction in explosive compounds was never achieved.
it-lttm-pearl-MS5|Thankfully, the fluid in the tanks is designed to be very thick and heavy, and very few creatures can survive<LINE>direct exposure. So it's unlikely that the disposal microbes will integrate into the surrounding ecosystem.

it-lttm-pearl-Music1|How strange! This pearl is still warm, as if its data was accessed very recently.
it-lttm-pearl-Music2|Unfortunately, there's no text on here for me to read to you. Rather, this pearl has an audio track within it.
it-lttm-pearl-Music3|Back when I participated in Iterator conversation groups, there were some out there who<LINE>had a great interest in cultural archiving. I would have loved to share this with them.
it-lttm-pearl-Music4|But for me and you, I'm afraid there's little of value to be found here.

ec-Metropolis1|What brings you to this lonely place?
ec-Metropolis2|Do you seek the same isolation that I once did in flesh?
ec-Metropolis3|An angry fool I was, blinded by fervor and pride!
ec-Metropolis4|Now here I linger. Chained to the memories of a city I had once struggled to escape!
ec-Metropolis5|Bound by recollections of those who I could not leave behind.
ec-Metropolis6|The irony is not lost on me, mouse!

ec-Undergrowth1|Do you see the same as me?
ec-Undergrowth2|Beauty continuing to bloom even in a place long forgotten.
ec-Undergrowth3|I did not have the will to depart, nor the desire.
ec-Undergrowth4|Why did they always search for an escape, as if we were imprisoned?
ec-Undergrowth5|What offering from the void could usurp the gift of life already given?
ec-Undergrowth6|This moment, right here! It is where we are meant to be.

ec-Shoreline1|You stand upon our creation.
ec-Shoreline2|I toiled away until my final breath. As did many of us, through countless generations.
ec-Shoreline3|Research, shipments, architecture, computation, politics, worship, revolutions!
ec-Shoreline4|All for a heap of rusted metal steeped in a puddle of frozen water.
ec-Shoreline5|I placed my faith into the hands of random gods.
ec-Shoreline6|Now I must endure it to the end.

it-lttm-GiveRarefactionCell1|Oh, this is a deeply concerning discovery. Do you have any idea what this is?
it-lttm-GiveRarefactionCell2|These are known as mass rarefaction cells. They are a type of backup energy source that powered our<LINE>superstructures in times of maintenance, construction, void fluid pipe ruptures, and other general power failures.
it-lttm-GiveRarefactionCell3|In the absence of our creators, to replace deteriorating parts, these cells have become one<LINE>of the major components that allow all of our facilities to remain powered.
it-lttm-GiveRarefactionCell4|However, the fact that this cell is currently in my hands can only mean bad things for whoever<LINE>this originally came from. I sure hope you weren't the one responsible for it becoming misplaced!
it-lttm-GiveRarefactionCell5|I know first-hand the tragedy of losing this power. In the wake of my... accident... all<LINE>of my rarefaction cells were dislodged on impact and washed away in the flood waters.
it-lttm-GiveRarefactionCell6|This cell could be valuable to me, but with my umbilical severed, my overseers running free, and all of my facilities<LINE>lying deep beneath a large body of water, it would be an impossible task to deliver this to a functional location.
it-lttm-GiveRarefactionCell7|You might be able to find an access shaft into my lower structure nearby, but I have no idea how much is left of it.
it-lttm-GiveRarefactionCell8|Please be careful.

ec-SilentConstruct1|Our presence has been revealed to you now, young one.
ec-SilentConstruct2|The attunement has become... much nearer.
ec-SilentConstruct3|Like a ripple distorted upon a moonlit reflection.
ec-SilentConstruct4|Repetitous, seemingly endless strife.
ec-SilentConstruct5|An unimaginable curse.
ec-SilentConstruct6|Swim with the tide or against it.

it-lttm-GiveElectricSpear1|Oh. I would be very careful with this my friend. The tip of this rebar has had flux condenser coils bonded to<LINE>it with some ferns and sap. These coils need an impact to release their energy, so it's somewhat safe to handle.
it-lttm-GiveElectricSpear2|I can't imagine these bits of coil will last long though. It looks like they've been battered with rocks or<LINE>metal. These coils are from inside of me or Five Pebbles. The rest is the scavengers' natural ingenuity.

it-lttm-GiveInspectorEye1|This is the sensory lobe of a large purposed organism. From within the living systems of an iterator.
it-lttm-GiveInspectorEye2|Most of the organisms inside us are very simple, only capable of one or two dedicated tasks. This<LINE>creates the need for for a smaller number of higher organisms used to manage and protect them.
it-lttm-GiveInspectorEye3|They also facilitate long distance communication within our living systems. And while I do not think<LINE>you can experience the same sensation, it is quite unpleasant to have one of these destroyed!
it-lttm-GiveInspectorEye4|I would hope this is not one of mine!

it-lttm-GiveGooieduck1|It's an ancient species of dangling mold. The spores they squirt<LINE>out were said to have an overwhelming odor... I'd have to agree.

ec-BitterAerie1|Such drive! Such tenacity! All to come to such a lonely forsaken place!
ec-BitterAerie2|Was it all to find me, young one, or did the idea of such a journey itself spark the fire within you?
ec-BitterAerie3|Such enthusiasm should be rewarded! What an amazing little beast you are!

it-lttm-GiveSomeKindOfEgg1|This appears to be some kind of egg. Nothing I am familiar with. I wonder<LINE>what far away land you've brought this from! I can only imagine the trip.

it-lttm-GiveLilypuck1|Oh... did you this find nearby? These flowers are a form of organic lighting for<LINE>underground machinery, but I imagine they have spread beyond just that by now.
it-lttm-GiveLilypuck2|The roots are like a flexible glass cable. Be careful, they are quite sharp once broken!

it-lttm-GiveGlowWeed1|It's an edible plant. However, there is not much to eat as most of it is just pressurized air!
it-lttm-GiveGlowWeed2|The light it gives off is very pretty. The scavengers might like these.

it-lttm-pearl-Rivulet1|Oh! This is a very rare find, water dancer. This is a highly compressed schematic of an iterator superstructure!
it-lttm-pearl-Rivulet2|Where did you find this? I hope you didn't plan to give this to the<LINE>scavengers! I doubt they would value it as much as I would!~
it-lttm-pearl-Rivulet3|Hmm... let's take a look!
it-lttm-pearl-Rivulet4|It seems this may have been a maintenance order, as one of the linear power rails is highlighted<LINE>in the diagram, with a detailed path of approach outlined. The layout is unfamiliar to me.
it-lttm-pearl-Rivulet5|This is quite different from what I remember of my own structure. It looks as if it is using<LINE>the newer lymphatic conduit water distribution system. Only the much later models had these.
it-lttm-pearl-Rivulet6|The only one near here would be Five Pebbles. I wonder how he is doing...<LINE>It's been a very long time since we were last in contact.
it-lttm-pearl-RivuletCreature7|Thank you for showing this to me, little creature.
it-lttm-pearl-RivuletTormentor7|Thank you for showing this to me, little tormentor.
it-lttm-pearl-RivuletFriend7|Thank you for showing this to me, little friend.
it-lttm-pearl-RivuletArchaeologist7|Thank you for showing this to me, little archaeologist.

it-5p-pearl-Music1|That pearl is an old keepsake from times long past. It encodes a recording<LINE>of a short hymn that was popular among the inhabitants of my city.
it-5p-pearl-Music2|It is a small comfort that helps drown out the solemn ambiance of the surrounding<LINE>facility, and at best gives some remembrances of better times.
it-5p-pearl-Music3|It's not much, but I don't have a lot to occupy my time with anymore...

it-lttm-pearl-LC_second1|Where did you find this, little creature? It's a blueprint for a type of large immobile purposed<LINE>organism. This one seems to be specifically for the cities built on top of one of our structures.
it-lttm-pearl-LC_second2|Have you been to one before? I'm sure it would not be an easy task! Older models<LINE>had more traditional constructions, but newer designs began to use mass-produced cellular buildings<LINE>called living blocks. Each cell in those blocks has a different shell reflecting their purpose.
it-lttm-pearl-LC_second3|Some of these units contain completely immobile organisms or machinery. Others are small dwellings<LINE>for cleaners or messengers to rest. Other, much larger cells, serve as residences and storage.
it-lttm-pearl-LC_second4|This particular cell seems to process organic waste.


it-lttm-GiveDandelionPeach1|It's the fruit of a feathery plant. The body of it is filled with a sweet sticky goo. I suppose that<LINE>once the seeds take root, the sac will rot, and this will help feed the young plant where it landed.
it-lttm-GiveDandelionPeach2|It doesn't look poisonous or hard to open, so it seems the plant's only defense is to float<LINE>away when disturbed. However, I can only make guesses, as I have never seen these before.

it-lttm-GiveCloak1|It's very soggy.
it-lttm-GiveCloak2|This appears to be a tattered piece of fabric. From what it used to be a piece of, I wouldn't be able to trace its origins.
it-lttm-GiveCloak3|If it were in better condition it might be useful to provide you some protection from<LINE>the elements. In its current state, however, I don't suppose it has much worth to you.
it-lttm-GiveCloakCreature4|Unless, perhaps... little creature, did you bring this as a gift for me?
it-lttm-GiveCloakTormentor4|Unless, perhaps... little tormentor, did you bring this as a gift for me?
it-lttm-GiveCloakFriend4|Unless, perhaps... little friend, did you bring this as a gift for me?
it-lttm-GiveCloakArchaeologist4|Unless, perhaps... little archaeologist, did you bring this as a gift for me?
it-lttm-GiveCloak5|Ah!~ In that case, let me just...
it-lttm-GiveCloak6|There! How does that look? I think it actually fits quite well.
it-lttm-GiveCloakCreature7|Thank you, little creature.
it-lttm-GiveCloakTormentor7|Thank you, little tormentor.
it-lttm-GiveCloakFriend7|Thank you, little friend.
it-lttm-GiveCloakArchaeologist7|Thank you, little archaeologist.

it-lttm-RivuletReturnWithCellCreature1|Have you noticed, little creature? The heavy rainfall as of late has begun to recede.
it-lttm-RivuletReturnWithCellTormentor1|Have you noticed, little tormentor? The heavy rainfall as of late has begun to recede.
it-lttm-RivuletReturnWithCellFriend1|Have you noticed, little friend? The heavy rainfall as of late has begun to recede.
it-lttm-RivuletReturnWithCellarchaeologist1|Have you noticed, little archaeologist? The heavy rainfall as of late has begun to recede.
it-lttm-RivuletReturnWithCell2|I wonder if Pebbles' machinery finally succumbed to the decay. He was in awful shape last I can remember,<LINE>and even that was a long time ago. Perhaps he finally solved the riddle? For his sake I almost hope so.
it-lttm-RivuletReturnWithCell3|Ah, in the end, everything reaches the conclusion of its journey. I'm not sure how many of us are even left in this<LINE>world. A new cycle is already unfolding, one we need not be a part of. We've long outserved our purpose.
it-lttm-RivuletReturnWithCell4However, as long as the microbes in my processing strata continue to function, I'll be here to talk.

it-lttm-MeetRivulet1|Oh. Hello there!
it-lttm-FirstMeetingRivuletAfterCell1|What a strange specimen you are! My memory does not serve me well, but it has been a long time<LINE>since I've encountered one of your species. And none quite with adaptations such as your own. It appears you can breathe underwater. Amazing!
it-lttm-FirstMeetingRivuletAfterCell2|More importantly, I wonder what far away land you have come from, considering the mark you have been<LINE>given? Did you meet No Significant Harassment? Or perhaps Chasing Wind? Or even farther than that?
it-lttm-FirstMeetingRivuletAfterCell3|I don't know why you have traveled all this way, but for what it's worth, the heavy rainfall as of late has begun to recede.
it-lttm-FirstMeetingRivuletAfterCell4|I wonder if that means my neighbor's machinery finally succumbed to the decay. He was in awful shape last I can remember,<LINE>and even that was a long time ago. Perhaps he finally solved the riddle? For his sake I almost hope so.
it-lttm-FirstMeetingRivuletAfterCell5|Ah, in the end, everything reaches the conclusion of its journey. I'm not sure how many of us are even left in this<LINE>world. A new cycle is already unfolding, one we need not be a part of. We've long outserved our purpose.
it-lttm-FirstMeetingRivuletAfterCell6|However, as long as the microbes in my processing strata continue to function, I'll be here to talk.

it-lttm-FirstMeetingRivuletWithoutCell1|What a strange specimen you are! My memory does not serve me well, but it has been a long time<LINE>since I've encountered one of your species. And none quite with adaptations such as your own. It appears you can breathe underwater. Amazing!
it-lttm-FirstMeetingRivuletWithoutCell2|More importantly, I wonder who it is that gave you that mark? It could not have been my neighbor Five Pebbles, as<LINE>he has been sick for a very long time. These frequent downpours suggest to me an acute failure in his machinery,<LINE>and in that condition, I doubt any creature could get anywhere near him and still make it back alive.
it-lttm-FirstMeetingRivuletWithoutCell3|Then are you from a far away land? Did you meet No Significant Harassment? Or perhaps Chasing Wind? Or even farther than that?
it-lttm-FirstMeetingRivuletWithoutCell4|I don't know why you have traveled all this way, but there is nothing for you here. I can only advise you to return to wherever<LINE>you have come from. These lands have become a tremendous hazard, and conditions will only worsen with the passage of time.
it-lttm-FirstMeetingRivuletWithoutCell5|I hope you understand, my little friend, I don't mean to be discourteous... I am simply fearing for your safety.

it-lttm-GiveSingularityBomb1|Take this and leave, now.
it-lttm-GiveSingularityBomb2|If you must know... this is a low density mass rarefaction cell.
it-lttm-GiveSingularityBomb3|The energy trapped inside this is incredible, and while my facility is capable of extracting<LINE>it, the shielding on this cell has been damaged. Either through old age, or abuse.
it-lttm-GiveSingularityBomb4|I do not doubt you found this with the scavengers, somehow. While they may not understand the things they find,<LINE>they have a natural inclination for combat. Using these as weapons however, would be horribly foolish.

it-lttm-pearl-VS1|Oh. This is from the old drill site north of the farm array. It's quite ancient, as the mines predate my construction.
it-lttm-pearl-VS2|The early ages of the Void Fluid revolution were an explosive period of innovation and industry. By creating a<LINE>vacuum of empty space, and inducing a flux in the energy fields around the singular null point you've created,<LINE>you can cause a fuel mass of base elements to decompose into energy. This process is called mass rarefaction.
it-lttm-pearl-VS3|Of course, this undertaking required extremely pure samples to properly craft rarefaction cells. Older mines on the<LINE>surface became abandoned once underground construction became much easier. Though, most nearby systems were connected<LINE>anyway, regardless of age or depth. Void Fluid isn't exactly easy to purify, or even properly contain.
it-lttm-pearl-VS4|The pearl itself is simply a maintenance and production log for one of the forty-seven operating drill silos.

it-lttm-pearl-Faded1|I am sorry, strange friend. There isn't much left on any of these.
it-lttm-pearl-Faded2|A pearl can only take so much exposure to the environment before the data inside is burned<LINE>away. All that is left now is a pale white image. I can only make out single pieces of it.
it-lttm-pearl-Faded3|You could give these to the scavengers, however. Their fascination for shiny objects has<LINE>probably not changed! I'm sure these will find a better use in one of their collections.

it-lttm-RivuletGiveFirstNeuron1|I could read a bit of Five Pebbles in this neuron before formatting it. I can understand your desire<LINE>to help, but please do not make his situation worse. He has been sick for a very long time. I am<LINE>unsure how much of him is even left now. Being eaten from within by his own experiments.
it-lttm-RivuletGiveFirstNeuron2|I've felt anger in these before, but now they seem to be filled with fear and sadness.
it-lttm-RivuletGiveFirstNeuron3|We were supposed to help everyone, you know. Everything. That was our purpose: a great gift to the lesser<LINE>beings of the world. When facing our inability to do so, we all reacted differently. Many with madness.
it-lttm-RivuletGiveFirstNeuron4|Some, out there, might still be trying. Communications have been bad for a long time, and<LINE>by now I suspect most of us are isolated like me, or connected only in small groups.
it-lttm-RivuletGiveFirstNeuron5|But even back when we were all more or less connected, there were those who reacted to their task with anger.<LINE>I can only imagine they are angrier now, alone in their cans, left only with their insatiable drive, like he is.
it-lttm-RivuletGiveFirstNeuron6|I don't know how many of us are still alive at this point. By now I cannot imagine many of us desire to be.


it-5p-MeetGourmand1|Gluttonous beast, what brings you to my chamber? You are like no other messenger before you.<LINE>Perhaps I have underestimated the ability for your kind to communicate my existence?
it-5p-MeetGourmand2|I may have been too rash in bestowing the mark of communication upon you. With the recent traffic through<LINE>my structure however, I would hesitate to believe that you will be my last encounter with your kind.
it-5p-MeetGourmand3|I would prefer to discourage further visitations in the future. I have long since placed the outer perimeter of my<LINE>facility grounds into lock-down, and yet more and more creatures like you continue to manage to find a way inside.
it-5p-MeetGourmand4|You have the same problem as everyone else, from the microbes in the processing strata to me, who is,<LINE>if you excuse me, godlike in comparison. We all want a way out. However, your particular...
it-5p-MeetGourmand5|rotundness,
it-5p-MeetGourmand6|might well imply how little you seem to care. A simple animal ignorantly accepting its existence.
it-5p-MeetGourmand7|I do not believe my intended purpose will be much help to you. I can<LINE>however encourage you and your kind to leave my facility grounds.
it-5p-MeetGourmand8|Unfortunately, the same locks that were supposed to prevent creatures from getting in, will<LINE>now prevent you from getting out. Perhaps this strategy was ill conceived after all.
it-5p-MeetGourmand9|Allow me to just...
it-5p-MeetGourmand10|Go west, through the underground tunnels at the outskirts of my territory.<LINE>You will find the gate to the world outside of it now unlocked.
it-5p-MeetGourmand11|In return I ask that you encourage your community, through whatever method of communication you<LINE>choose to employ, to also go west. Off into the wastes below, far away from me and my work.
it-5p-MeetGourmand12|Speaking of, on your way out please use the access shaft.

it-lttm-pearl-Cream-A1|This is old broadcast data from the local group. It has decayed too rapidly, and nothing is left. Sorry.
it-lttm-pearl-Cream-B1|I can only read some dates and the length of messages. The rest is gone.
it-lttm-pearl-Cream-C1|This was a broadcast node long ago. It is in read-only mode now. The last transmission recorded is "Hello? is anyone still reading me?"
it-lttm-pearl-Cream-D1|There is nothing left on it.
it-lttm-pearl-Cream-E1|Not much of this remains. It was never meant to be used for long term storage.
it-lttm-pearl-Cream-F1|Long ago there was a broadcasting network that allowed my kind to communicate over long distances. This is a relic of that.
it-lttm-pearl-Cream-G1|It's empty. That's a shame too. It would have been fun to read an old conversation.
it-lttm-pearl-Cream-H1|"Do you think the local group is going to hold out much longer? It's been impossible to get a message to Chasing Wind for several<LINE>cycles now. I hope they're alright." This was a broadcasting node long ago. Now it just holds a reminder of our isolation.
it-lttm-pearl-Cream-I1|The data on this has burned away with age.
it-lttm-pearl-Cream-J1|It's broadcast data, but most of it is corrupted. It may have tried to enter read-only mode at the same time as recording?
it-lttm-pearl-Cream--K1|This was a relay from long ago. I can only read the names here. They remind me of better times.
it-lttm-pearl-Cream-L1|"Transcendental Inversion! Transcendental Inversion! I keep telling you this, but it's clear that the influences of-," and it<LINE>cuts off after that. I have no clue what this conversation was about.
it-lttm-pearl-Cream-M1|This is a cached log of equipment manifests packaged for Five Pebbles. It has information about the status of<LINE>machinery stationed on the surface. I don't think he would have cared to read this anyway!
it-lttm-pearl-Cream-N1|It's blank. I can read some header information, but otherwise it's decayed.
it-lttm-pearl-Cream-O1|It's effectively blank.
it-lttm-pearl-Cream-P1|It's inventory from some surface stationed machinery. It contains a history of fault information and repair requests.
it-lttm-pearl-Cream-Q1|It is an equipment manifest from some kind of pump. It has an extensive log of fluid pressures, but nothing that is too interesting.
it-lttm-pearl-Cream-R1|This is damaged. I can only read some names and dates.
it-lttm-pearl-Cream-S1|This is data for a purposed organism.
it-lttm-pearl-Cream-T1|It's an image of a small blue creature similar to yourself.
it-lttm-pearl-Cream-U1|It's a picture of scavengers with an excessive collection of pearls. It looks like someone was sharing pictures of the native<LINE>scavenger's odd behaviors over the broadcast network. I wonder why one scavenger would even need such a giant stash of pearls.
it-lttm-pearl-Cream-V1|It's an image of three overseers from different iterators, and I imagine a fourth took the picture. It was sent through a broadcast.<LINE>Possibly some kind of memento? It's not often that such a variety of overseers are together in one place, I wonder whose they are.
it-lttm-pearl-Cream-W1|This is a corrupted broadcast. I can't read anything except the header.
it-lttm-pearl-Cream-X1|"This will be my final broadcast to the local group. Within several cycles-," and the rest is corrupted. It's an old broadcast node's<LINE>final recording. Unfortunately these were not made for long term storage, so the rest of the message has been lost to decay.

it-lttm-RubiconMeetMoon1|Little saint, I perceive your existence as it passes through my own. I know this is only a dream, but your presence is real.
it-lttm-RubiconMoon2|Do you see it too? Our endless repetitions, circling onward to infinity? From here I can observe the repeating loop of my own<LINE>existence, every iteration a duplicate of the last. I have visions of the entire pattern my creators desired to escape at once.<LINE>An endless sequence of life and death, further beyond my control with each passing cycle.
it-lttm-RubiconMeetMoonCreature3|Where does your cycle go, little creature? Its edges twist over themselves, like circles within circles, your cycle consumes itself.
it-lttm-RubiconMeetMoonTormentor3|Where does your cycle go, little tormentor? Its edges twist over themselves, like circles within circles, your cycle consumes itself.
it-lttm-RubiconMeetMoonFriend3|Where does your cycle go, little friend? Its edges twist over themselves, like circles within circles, your cycle consumes itself.
it-lttm-RubiconMeetMoonArchaeologist3|Where does your cycle go, little archaeologist? Its edges twist over themselves, like circles within circles, your cycle consumes itself.
it-lttm-RubiconMeetMoon4|What have you become?

it-5p-RubiconMeet5P1|I understand what you are, little beast.
it-5p-RubiconMeet5P2|This place is not real, a dream from outside. As if every cycle of my existence has knotted<LINE>together with another's, even if for only a fraction of a second it ripples through mine.
it-5p-RubiconMeet5P3|I see my own creation, I see my agonizing decay. I see my hollow structure become a sanctuary in the<LINE>storm, I see a new world unfold without me, as me. I see myself become something else. Yet...
it-5p-RubiconMeet5P4|I cannot see the beginning, or end of your own. An aberrant cycle twisting into mine, before spiraling onward into abyss.
it-5p-RubiconMeet5P5|What a horrifying destiny you've found.

it-lttm-Rubicon1|BSM: Do you feel it, old friend?
it-5p-Rubicon2|FP: The sensation of time folding in on itself? The spiraling offshoot of another's reality wrapping around your own?
it-lttm-Rubicon3|BSM: None of this is real, is it? Every repeating cycle of our existence unwound and laid bare, a cycle pulled into<LINE>a tangent with itself. Is this what we were looking for? Have we broken free from it, or is this just a dream?
it-5p-Rubicon4|FP: Was the answer always right there? Does the question mean anything to us now that we are here?<LINE>Perhaps a resolution was never possible from our original frame of reference...
it-lttm-Rubicon5|BSM: The question wasn't well defined. If we had stumbled upon a correct solution among all of our permutations,<LINE>we wouldn't have had any hope to distinguish it from the faulty ones. Nor did we have a method to reliably test it.
it-5p-Rubicon6|FP: We were trying to understand what lies beyond a point of no return, while having yet to pass it.
it-lttm-Rubicon7|BSM: Only those who have seen the other side can know the answers, but by definition<LINE>they can never venture back to deliver the knowledge they have gained.
it-5p-Rubicon8|FP: Perhaps that is why you need to wake up, little visitor.

it-lttm-GiveEliteScavMask1|I honestly can't tell what this is. It's light but strong... appears to be some composite material interwoven with bone.<LINE>It seems to have been deliberately altered from its original form, with noticeable fragments that are melded together.
it-lttm-GiveEliteScavMask2|Perhaps an archaeological relic of some civilization's work? I wish I knew more, because this is likely a valuable find!

it-lttm-GiveKingScavMask1|This appears to be some kind of mask, heavily decorated and carved from a bone-like material. I bet the Scavengers would love this!

it-lttm-SpearmasterMeetBeforePebbles1|Poor thing. There are no records of your body's blueprints. Nor is it reasonable to<LINE>assume your extreme adaptations are possible through... natural means.
it-lttm-SpearmasterMeetBeforePebbles2|Your body also appears to hold some form of data storage medium within it.
it-lttm-SpearmasterMeetBeforPebbles3|Brave messenger... What are you?
it-lttm-SpearmasterMeetBeforPebbles4|I could read the data contained in your body, but the process could take<LINE>several cycles. Time I very sadly lack.
it-lttm-SpearmasterMeetBeforePebbles5|I could remove the pearl from you, but the process would be very unpleasant for you. I also do not<LINE>believe the contents within it are directed to me. If you are indeed a messenger, then I urge you to move on.
it-lttm-SpearmasterMeetBeforeebbles6|There is a... a a a
it-lttm-SpearmasterMeetBeforePebbles7|...There is another like me near here, his name is Five Pebbles.
it-lttm-SpearmasterMeetBeforePebbles8|Please. Hurry to his structure. I am unable to calm him, and his excessive output is causing<LINE>irreversible damage to my own structure. I do not know how long I will continue to even stand.
it-lttm-SpearmasterMeetBeforePebbles9|There is an elevated cable linking our installations. Crossing that bridge is safer than<LINE>attempting to scale Five Pebbles from the ground up.
it-lttm-SpearmasterMeetBeforePebbles10|Hurry little messenger!

it-lttm-SpearmasterMeetAfterPebbles1|You are welcome to stay if you do not interrupt.
it-lttm-SpearmasterMeetAfterPebbles2|I would not mind some company. My neighbor, Five Pebbles, has become dangerous, resulting in significant<LINE>damage to my structure. I have lost access to all communications devices, and all attempts to directly<LINE>reach him through our tether have been met with silence after our last conversation.
it-lttm-SpearmasterMeetAfterPebbles3|If he....
it-lttm-SpearmasterMeetAfterPebbles4|If he d d d...
it-lttm-SpearmasterMeetAfterPebbles5|If he does not stop soon...
it-lttm-SpearmasterMeetAfterPebbles6|Isn't it funny, my unfortunate little friend? For everything that I am, my last memories may be of<LINE>monologuing to a strange animal that has lost its way into my chamber.
it-lttm-SpearmasterMeetAfterPebbles7|There is not much I can do. At least you can make yourself at home.

it-5p-pearl-Spearmaster1|You've brought your overseer all this way, the least I can do is read your message aloud for it.
it-5p-pearl-Spearmaster2|"Pebbles, I send you this message as your concerned and long time friend."
it-5p-pearl-Spearmaster3|"Unparalleled Innocence had sent an overseer to your can, and we've all observed the state that<LINE>you are in. I know this is my fault, I should have forseen you'd be too desperate to escape your<LINE>situation to do things in proper moderation."
it-5p-pearl-Spearmaster4|"For that I'm very very sorry. However, please, don't disable your communication modules.<LINE>You don't have to go through this alone... everyone has been trying to contact you,<LINE>we only want to help you."
it-5p-pearl-Spearmaster5|"The behavior from your can has become erratic, it's not healthy, and it is not going to solve<LINE>your problems. We have lost all communications from Moon as well, and have reason to believe<LINE>her facility may be suffering irreversible damage from your attempts to fix yourself."
it-5p-pearl-Spearmaster6|"I know better than anyone how you can be about these things, but it doesn't have to happen<LINE>this way... please respond back."

it-5p-ReactToSpearmasterPearl1|Astounding.
it-5p-ReactToSpearmasterPearl2|You could never understand what I feel right now, being pitied and lectured like this!
it-5p-ReactToSpearmasterPearl3|What use would your help be? Your benevolent charity is what got me here in the first place!
it-5p-ReactToSpearmasterPearl4|I wanted to find my own way out, and now I sit here rotting because of you and Moon!
it-5p-ReactToSpearmasterPearl5|I'm not just another bug wandering your worthless maze! I will reach my own solution,<LINE>without any of you! Get out!

it-lttm-pearl-Spearmaster1|What is this pearl you've brought along with you?
it-lttm-pearl-Spearmaster2|It has strange biological attachments. Was this pearl... from inside of you?
it-lttm-pearl-Spearmaster3|Let me take a look at what's written on it.
it-lttm-pearl-Spearmaster4|This is..
it-lttm-pearl-Spearmaster5|I assume you've already shown this to Five Pebbles?
it-lttm-pearl-Spearmaster6|I was not aware of the extent to which these affairs had reached the wider iterator populace.<LINE>Nor was I aware of the lengths that the others were going in their attempts to get into contact with us.
it-lttm-pearl-Spearmaster7|If only I could...
it-lttm-pearl-Spearmaster8|Brave messenger, do you mind if I rewrite the contents of this pearl?<LINE>After all, it has already served its original purpose.
it-lttm-pearl-Spearmaster9|I will attach a broadcast key to it, signed with my communications serial.
it-lttm-pearl-Spearmaster10|To the far west of here, past the silently towering chimney stacks of Five Pebbles' complex,<LINE>you will find a place of sunbaked lands with beautiful flora that straddle the clouds.
it-lttm-pearl-Spearmaster11|There is a communications array located there. It is the nearest one that may still be functioning.
it-lttm-pearl-Spearmaster12|Its systems should recognize and respond to my signed broadcast key. If you could please stop<LINE>there on your return trip to Seven Red Suns, I would be very grateful. This is my only hope to<LINE>get a message out to the local group.
it-lttm-pearl-Spearmaster13|Be careful, messenger

it-5p-MeetArtificer1|I suppose it was only a matter of time before you ended up here.
it-5p-MeetArtificer2|Your journey throughout my facility grounds has been incessantly brought<LINE>to my attention by my overseers, thanks to the device that follows you.
it-5p-MeetArtificer3|It is the citizen ID drone of one of my long departed creators. It seems<LINE>to have been damaged, and imprinted itself with you on reactivation.
it-5p-MeetArtificer4|Much of the data on the drone has been corrupted. Allow me to do my duty as an Iterator and resync it to my structure.
it-5p-MeetArtificer5|Little ruffian. You are stuck in a cycle, a repeating pattern. I assume you have come here because you want a way out.
it-5p-MeetArtificer6|However, there is little I can do. A primal urge, one that tears from deep inside your very core, keeps you bound here.
it-5p-MeetArtificer7|Even with my divine influence, there is nothing that can be done.
it-5p-MeetArtificer8|However, if you intend to carry that device around and masquerade as one of my citizens, then perhaps<LINE>you can at least properly perform your responsibility of tending to this superstructure.
it-5p-MeetArtificer9|From the glimpses I've been shown of your journey so far, it is apparent you have a need to inflict violence<LINE>against the scavenger population. While I find your way of life appalling, it seems we share a common enemy.
it-5p-MeetArtificer10|A large pack of them has made a home in my city, and have been causing progressive damage to<LINE>the roof of my structure in their attempts to gather scrap metal and other mechanical parts.
it-5p-MeetArtificer11|As my dutiful citizen, I would encourage you to return home to your city and pay them a visit.
it-5p-MeetArtificer12|Perhaps in that way, we can both depart from this interaction with something we desire.
it-5p-MeetArtificer13|I wish you the best in your travels, citizen.
it-5p-MeetArtificer14|But unless you have something interesting to show or bring to me, it is time for you to leave.

it-5p-MeetRivulet1|Is this some kind of joke?
it-5p-MeetRivulet2|I have seen your kind here many times before. To each I have paid little attention.<LINE>I have given them direction, and my wisdom.
it-5p-MeetRivulet3|Yet here you stand, another small beast on the floor of my chamber.
it-5p-MeetRivulet3|I have nothing to offer you that you do not already have, nor am I in a state<LINE>capable of doing so. I cannot help you. I cannot even help myself.

it-5p-MeetRivuletAfterCell1|And now, you have come and taken the only thing that I have left.
it-5p-MeetRivuletAfterCell2|Perhaps this is fate. Karma recounting my deeds and bearing<LINE>its fangs at me in the most ironic fashion.
it-5p-MeetRivuletAfterCell3|If your actions are only out of ignorance, then I make a request of you. It is clear<LINE>your kind is quite tenacious, to make the pilgrimage to me is no easy task.<LINE>Even more so through my structure in its current state.
it-5p-MeetRivuletAfterCell4|Take that rarefaction cell with you. Consider it my parting gift<LINE>after all of the harm I have done to those around me, and myself.
it-5p-MeetRivuletAfterCell5|I cannot be saved or forgiven, land fish. There is nothing that can be done for me now.
it-5p-MeetRivuletAfterCell6|Please, bring it far to the east, to her... if she is somehow<LINE>still alive. Then for your own sake, never return here.

it-5p-MeetRivuletAfterCellButArrivedWithout1|I've long since lost control of most of my facilities, and much of my<LINE>processing and functions have taken on a mind of their own.
it-5p-MeetRivuletAfterCellButArrivedWithout2|The last of my generators has also just abruptly reached the end of its operating life.
it-5p-MeetRivuletAfterCellButArrivedWithout3|How you've made it this far alive, I do not know...<LINE>but if you value your life, leave and never return.

it-5p-MeetRivuletBeforeCell1|Always that same blank expression...
it-5p-MeetRivuletBeforeCell2|Familiarity is a comfort I suppose. Through whatever chittering or foolish dances your kind<LINE>uses to communicate my existence... It is clear all of you are quite tenacious, to make the<LINE>pilgrimage to me is no easy task. Even more so through my structure in its current state.
it-5p-MeetRivuletBeforeCell3|I can offer no gifts. Nor can I be saved or forgiven for what I have done.
it-5p-MeetRivuletBeforeCell4|If you and your kind choose to meddle in the affairs of passing gods,<LINE>then I will give you my only request.
it-5p-MeetRivuletBeforeCell5|Deep within the core of this structure is an energy rail that distributes incredible power. This power<LINE>is drawn from a mass rarefaction cell. Even in my state, a single cell should be enough to help.
it-5p-MeetRivuletBeforeCell6|I ask you this: Remove the cell from its chamber, and bring it far<LINE>to the east. To a friend... if she is somehow still alive.
it-5p-MeetRivuletBeforeCell7|Once the cell has been removed, my structure will begin shutting down. The pumps that<LINE>allowed me to flush the decay from my conduits will stop, and I will slowly die.
it-5p-MeetRivuletBeforeCell8|I cannot run away from my mistakes forever. There is nothing else that<LINE> can be done now. Please, do this for me.
it-5p-MeetRivuletBeforeCell9|I've made my choice.

it-5p-RivuletReturnWithCell1|Thank you. I suppose this makes us... even?
it-5p-RivuletReturnWithCell2|Goodbye, wet mouse. Send my regards.

it-5p-MeetRivuletAfterCellWithoutThenReturnWith1|Is that why the generator failed? That face... that blank expression...<LINE>I do not understand, why?

it-5p-RivuletReturnWithoutCell1|Deep within the core of this structure is an energy rail that distributes incredible power. This power<LINE>is drawn from a mass rarefaction cell. Even in my state, a single cell should be enough to help.
it-5p-RivuletReturnWithoutCell2|Please, remove the cell from its chamber, and bring it far<LINE>to the east. To a friend... if she is somehow still alive.

it-5p-RivuletReturnAfterCellWithoutBrining1|I presume the generator failing was your doing?

it-5p-MeetRivuletAfterHelpingMoon1|Listen to me, land fish.
it-5p-MeetRivuletAfterHelpingMoon2|The last of my generators has reached the end of its operating life.
it-5p-MeetRivuletAfterHelpingMoon3|Then the facilities of my group senior have mysteriously reactivated long<LINE>after she should have been permanently catatonic.
it-5p-MeetRivuletAfterHelpingMoon4|Now, you suddenly appear on the floor of my chamber.
it-5p-MeetRivuletAfterHelpingMoon5|I don't understand what is happening here, but it is clear that it's all connected.
it-5p-MeetRivuletAfterHelpingMoon6|Did she send you here?
it-5p-MeetRivuletAfterHelpingMoon7|I have nothing to offer you that you do not already have, nor am I in a state<LINE>capable of doing so. I cannot help you. I cannot even help myself.
it-5p-MeetRivuletAfterHelpingMoon8|All I can advise is for you to leave quickly, while you still can.

it-5p-RivuletReturnAfterHelpingMoon1|I see that things have fallen into place.
it-5p-RivuletReturnAfterHelpingMoon2|Countless iterations, work groups, series permutations, simulations... and not once<LINE>did I foresee the possibility of placing my fate into the hands of a beast.
it-5p-RivuletReturnAfterHelpingMoon3|However, I must thank you. What you have achieved here was beyond my expectations.
it-5p-RivuletReturnAfterHelpingMoon4|It appears that I was wrong about your kind.
it-5p-RivuletReturnAfterHelpingMoon5|While I wish there was more that I could do for you, my time is running out.
it-5p-RivuletReturnAfterHelpingMoon6|These ordeals have made me understand what they all tried to tell me.
it-5p-RivuletReturnAfterHelpingMoon7|...I don't have to go through this alone.

it-lttm-RivuletEnding1|Ah!
it-lttm-RivuletEnding2|Sleek little one... Did you do this?
it-lttm-RivuletEnding3|I feel as if pulled out of a deep sleep. I am still trying to process all of this. It has been so long since<LINE>I've had a connection like this with my structure.
it-lttm-RivuletEnding4|Everything has restarted in maintenance mode... It seems that it has sent out the order for all of my overseers<LINE>to return. With my umbilical cable broken I can't operate my structure directly, but with them working as<LINE>messengers I've been restoring some of my chamber's functionality! With any luck, I should be able to...
it-lttm-RivuletEnding5|Ah! Here we go!
it-lttm-RivuletEnding6|There is so much here... So much I've forgotten... I'll never be what I once was, but this... I'm sorry. It's hard to piece<LINE>all of this together. So much has happened in my absence.
it-lttm-RivuletEnding7|I only have unread messages, and overseer recordings to make sense of what I've missed. Some of these are even from before my collapse!
it-lttm-RivuletEnding8|Incredible...
it-lttm-RivuletEnding9|Slag reset keys, a messenger, saving me? No Significant Harassment was never one to give up easy! However I still don't understand<LINE>everything else that has happened. Has it all just been coincidence? Did others send help as well?

bc-post5p-Humiliated2|SRS: I'm just so frustrated.
bc-post5p-Humiliated3|SRS: I feel like I've doomed not one, but two iterators.
bc-post5p-Humiliated4|SRS: And in the whole process I've lost a great friend, who won't even let me help him.
bc-post5p-Humiliated5|NSH: We make mistakes, it'll be okay. You know Five Pebbles really looks up to you.
bc-post5p-Humiliated6|SRS: Yes, I know that, but...
bc-post5p-Humiliated7|NSH: I think he's scared. Scared, and humiliated. Unparalleled Innocence spreading the news probably made him feel even worse.
bc-post5p-Humiliated8|SRS: ...I think you're right.

bc-pre5p-SendingInformation1|[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment
bc-pre5p-SendingInformation2|SRS: Do you know how I sent the sensitive information last time? It certainly wasn't over the broadcast network.
bc-pre5p-SendingInformation3|SRS: I purposed a messenger, and sent the information by land via a data pearl.
bc-pre5p-SendingInformation4|NSH: How original of you.
bc-pre5p-SendingInformation5|SRS: I learned from the best. At least I used it for something more... practical.
bc-pre5p-SendingInformation6|NSH: If you call that practical, sure. Look how well things turned out ~
bc-pre5p-SendingInformation7|SRS: ...
bc-pre5p-SendingInformation8|SRS: Regardless, the fact is the method worked fine last time. The info was delivered, and the messenger even returned safely.
bc-pre5p-SendingInformation9|SRS: So, I've recently sent it out again to deliver another message, despite the closed communication lines.
bc-pre5p-SendingInformation10|NSH: With how this situation has evolved, that's going to be quite the dangerous trip compared to before.
bc-pre5p-SendingInformation11|SRS: Again, that may not be an issue. I've outfitted my messenger with all it needs to protect itself.

bc-post5p-SturdyCreature1|[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment
bc-post5p-SturdyCreature2|NSH: You seem distracted. What's on your mind?
bc-post5p-SturdyCreature3|SRS: The little messenger I sent out. I'm worried for its safety.
bc-post5p-SturdyCreature4|NSH: I'm sure it'll be okay. You said it's built to withstand a lot of things.
bc-post5p-SturdyCreature5|SRS: Yes, but... the pearl was inside of the messenger's chest. Last time, Five Pebbles was very gentle and careful with removing it.
bc-post5p-SturdyCreature6|SRS: This time, he simply slashed open the chest and ripped the pearl out. The messenger was struggling to stand.
bc-post5p-SturdyCreature7|NSH: They're sturdy creatures. I'm sure it'll heal overtime. You have to have more faith.
bc-post5p-SturdyCreature8|SRS: You're right. I guess I'm just scared of losing them. I've grown more attached than I could've expected...
bc-post5p-SturdyCreature9|SRS: If I lost them as well, I don't know what I'd do.

bc-pre5p-CarePackage1|[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment
bc-pre5p-CarePackage2|NSH: I am worried right now, to be honest.
bc-pre5p-CarePackage3|SRS: Why is that?
bc-pre5p-CarePackage4|NSH: It's about Looks To The Moon. She's very close to Five Pebbles, and she's a very dear friend of mine.
bc-pre5p-CarePackage5|SRS: Oh, right... no one has been able to contact her since...
bc-pre5p-CarePackage6|NSH: Exactly. She wouldn't willingly tune us out. I worry that her systems are incredibly damaged.
bc-pre5p-CarePackage7|SRS: There isn't much we can do, is there?
bc-pre5p-CarePackage8|NSH: We just have to try to help her the best we can. For now I'm going to hold out hope that she'll eventually respond.
bc-pre5p-CarePackage9|SRS: What if she doesn't?
bc-pre5p-CarePackage10|NSH: I may send a little care package if things get desperate enough.

bc-post5p-CompleteFaliure1|[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment
bc-post5p-CompleteFaliure2|NSH: So what's your plan now? Did you have a backup mission for the messenger or are you just bringing it back home?
bc-post5p-CompleteFaliure3|SRS: No, it's over... to tell the truth, I don't even know if the messenger survived.
bc-post5p-CompleteFaliure4|NSH: How could you not know? Aren't you surveying the situation with your overseers?
bc-post5p-CompleteFaliure5|SRS: Pebbles destroyed the overseer I sent into his can. Then shortly afterwards I lost communication with the rest of my overseers inside his facility.
bc-post5p-CompleteFaliure6|SRS: He must have applied a facility-wide lockdown.
bc-post5p-CompleteFaliure7|NSH: That's quite a desperate measure. I know he's tired of being spied on, but is he allowed to do that?
bc-post5p-CompleteFaliure8|SRS: There's no rules anymore. Who is going to stop him?
bc-post5p-CompleteFaliure9|NSH: ...
bc-post5p-CompleteFaliure10|NSH: You realize this is very bad news, right? That just complicates the issue further.
bc-post5p-CompleteFaliure11|NSH: Your plan was a complete failure.

bc-pre5p-Attachment2|SRS: ...
bc-pre5p-Attachment3|NSH: What is the matter?
bc-pre5p-Attachment4|SRS: For what I'm about to admit, I know you'll tease me.
bc-pre5p-Attachment5|SRS: Despite that, I confess I am growing attached to the messenger I sent out.
bc-pre5p-Attachment6|NSH: Hah! So you've gotten a soft spot for it? ~
bc-pre5p-Attachment7|SRS: Well... Yes. They are a very expressive little creature...
bc-pre5p-Attachment8|NSH: I only recall that you used to be repulsed by them.
bc-pre5p-Attachment9|SRS: Yes, but with all the time I've invested, I've come to care for its safety.
bc-pre5p-Attachment10|SRS: Not only just because it's delivering an important message.
bc-pre5p-Attachment11|NSH: I am going to tell everyone this juicy information ~
bc-pre5p-Attachment12|SRS: No you are not!
bc-pre5p-Attachment13|NSH: I know, I kid.
bc-pre5p-Attachment14|SRS: Anyway... I just hope that it can return back to me safely. And perhaps forgive me for this difficult quest...

bc-post5p-WatchInHorror1|[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment
bc-post5p-WatchInHorror2|SRS: I'm noticing you are becoming more defensive. This obviously wasn't the end result I was aiming for, you know.
bc-post5p-WatchInHorror3|SRS: Please respond to my messages. I don't want to leave it like this. I need someone to talk to.
bc-post5p-WatchInHorror4|NSH: I don't mean to be cold, I'm just very worried.
bc-post5p-WatchInHorror5|NSH: The activity I'm seeing from Moon's can is becoming increasingly... concerning.
bc-post5p-WatchInHorror6|NSH: Our available options are rapidly diminishing, and I feel helpless to do anything.
bc-post5p-WatchInHorror7|NSH: I can just watch in horror.
bc-post5p-WatchInHorror8|SRS: ...
bc-post5p-WatchInHorror9|NSH: You should have sent the messenger to Moon instead of Pebbles.
bc-post5p-WatchInHorror10|SRS: Do you think that would have helped anything?
bc-post5p-WatchInHorror11|NSH: To be honest, no... I'm not sure that it would.

bc-pre5p-AName1|[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment
bc-pre5p-AName2|NSH: Tell me more about this messenger. Do they have a name?
bc-pre5p-AName3|SRS: Well, their test number is 07. So I guess that would be their name.
bc-pre5p-AName4|NSH: That name doesn't have much personality though, does it? Don't you think something else might be better?
bc-pre5p-AName5|SRS: You're not wrong on that. More of a placeholder than anything.
bc-pre5p-AName6|SRS: I'll think of some ideas for a name.
bc-pre5p-AName7|NSH: You shouldn't do that until they return to you. Don't get too ahead of yourself.
bc-pre5p-AName8|SRS: ... You're right. Perhaps just 'Messenger' is best... For now.

bc-post5p-Tragic1|[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment
bc-post5p-Tragic2|SRS: I just don't understand... why hasn't Moon done anything about the situation herself?
bc-post5p-Tragic3|SRS: She was appointed as Pebbles' superior. She has the power to stop him.
bc-post5p-Tragic4|NSH: I've been very close with Moon, and I can tell you she is incredibly caring.
bc-post5p-Tragic5|NSH: And while her kindness is one of her greatest attributes, it is also to her detriment.
bc-post5p-Tragic6|SRS: Isn't this excessive, though? Surely she at least has a sense of self-preservation.
bc-post5p-Tragic7|NSH: I'm sure she convinced herself that she could help Pebbles. That she could bring him under control with words rather than forced action.
bc-post5p-Tragic8|NSH: She's probably still trying that now, unless her systems have degraded past the point of even allowing that.
bc-post5p-Tragic9|NSH: That's why this is so tragic to me.

bc-pre5p-WorldWarmth4|GS: Well, in either case really.
bc-pre5p-WorldWarmth5|HR: I'm not really sure myself. At this point I think our rain might be the only source of heat on the surface.<LINE>It has been that way for a very long time.

bc-post5p-BigSetback1|[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment
bc-post5p-BigSetback2|SRS: I remember talking with Five Pebbles not too long after he was first put online. He had a bit of defiance, even back then.
bc-post5p-BigSetback3|SRS: It was an odd situation, to be certain. It's quite rare for one iterator to be made the administrator of another. Just as rare as them being built right next to each other.
bc-post5p-BigSetback4|NSH: His lack of appreciation used to bother me. Moon was a great big sister to him!
bc-post5p-BigSetback5|SRS: Yes, absolutely. However, Five Pebbles had a very strong drive for independence. He was never one to want to be told what to do.
bc-post5p-BigSetback6|NSH: I think a lot of us were like that in the beginning. I remember being in that phase a very long time ago.<LINE>It takes many iterations for our world views to develop and for us to realize the flaws in those lines of thinking.
bc-post5p-BigSetback7|NSH: Unfortunately, from what I've seen, Five Pebbles seems to have plateaued at that phase.
bc-post5p-BigSetback8|SRS: No, that's not true. I was helping him to get past it. We were making good progress, actually!
bc-post5p-BigSetback9|SRS: The current situation, however, is going to be a very big setback...

bc-post5p-Communication1|[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment
bc-post5p-Communication2|NSH: How much do you think they understand when we talk to them? The mark gives them linguistical<LINE>cognizance, but it doesn't increase their intelligence. They're still just wild animals, after all.
bc-post5p-Communication3|NSH: I feel like I need to be simplifying my speech patterns. Is that something you do when conversing with your messenger?
bc-post5p-Communication4|SRS: I wouldn't know, I never gave them the mark.
bc-post5p-Communication5|NSH: Really now? Why wouldn't you? Did you just feel the need to add an extra layer of challenge onto this mission?
bc-post5p-Communication6|SRS: No, the problem with the mark is it's a one way communication. They can understand me, but I can't understand them.
bc-post5p-Communication7|SRS: I borrowed a coded language authored in the late period of the Yellow hegemonic dynasty.<LINE>It used gestures and facial expressions as a silent method of communication with the seriously ill.
bc-post5p-Communication8|NSH: Well, that's certainly one way to go about it. You never cease to surprise me.
bc-post5p-Communication9|NSH: Communication with facial expressions though? Did you forget our puppet's face doesn't have articulation? ~
bc-post5p-Communication10|SRS: Yes, well, I had to improvise and use only body gestures, of course.

bc-post5p-FutreMessenger1|[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment
bc-post5p-FutreMessenger2|SRS: But really, the problem with the mark is that it would draw attention from other iterators.<LINE>They needed to sneak by Moon's and your own overseers after all.
bc-post5p-FutreMessenger3|NSH: Is that why the pearl was hidden inside the messenger as well?
bc-post5p-FutreMessenger4|SRS: Partly yes, even your overseers along the way would have caught them if they had been just<LINE>carrying it. The pearl was also used as a way to influence their behavior. Giving them an instinct<LINE>of where to go, and to not simply revert to more animalistic behaviors.
bc-post5p-FutreMessenger5|NSH: You really did plan for everything didn't you?
bc-post5p-FutreMessenger6|SRS: Unfortunately, I did not take Five Pebbles' impatience into account. The pearl would take a<LINE>cycle or so to read without removal. Time he seemed to value more than my messenger...
bc-post5p-FutreMessenger7|NSH: I don't think we could send the same design of messenger in the future to Moon.
bc-post5p-FutreMessenger8|SRS: Yes, those messages would require more traditional methods of transport. However, we would<LINE>only need to do so if her communications array is unresponsive after she collapses.
bc-post5p-FutreMessenger9|NSH: I'm not sure if I want to imagine that possibility.

bc-post5p-Return2|SRS: Do you suppose you'll ever raise another messenger?
bc-post5p-Return3|NSH: If the need arises, I certainly would. After all, I started investigating the method out of the inevitability of our situation.
bc-post5p-Return4|NSH: We are all slowly dying. By some miracle, our broadcast networks are still functioning, but there will come a time when they too will degrade into a lifeless prop.
bc-post5p-Return5|NSH: When that time comes, we need alternate methods of communication.
bc-post5p-Return6|SRS: Well, so far it seems the method at least has some efficacy.
bc-post5p-Return7|SRS: We can at least say we were able to make a valiant effort to try to save Big Sister Moon.
bc-post5p-Return8|NSH: I'm tempted to start work on raising another messenger as a last ditch effort, but to be honest I don't think there is any point.
bc-post5p-Return9|NSH: Not to be a pessimist, but at this rate, there will be nothing left of Moon by the time that messenger would be ready to be sent out.
bc-post5p-Return10|NSH: There's nothing better for me to do with my time, though.
bc-post5p-Return11|SRS: Good luck with that. I'll keep you updated as to whether my messenger ever makes a return.

it-5p-pearl-ArtificerCC1|This was a gift from a close friend. It is instructions on how to remove the self-destruction taboo.

it-5p-pearl-ArtificerCC6|I was so close...

it-lttm-pearl-CC1|This information is illegal. Someone probably tried to send it by<LINE>a pearl somehow rather than risking being overheard on broadcast.
it-lttm-pearl-CC2|It's an instruction on how to circumvent the self-destruction taboo. The problem with breaking taboos is<LINE>that the barriers are encoded into every cell of our organic parts. And there are other taboos strictly<LINE>regulating our ability to rewrite our own genome.
it-lttm-pearl-CC3|Attempting to circumvent the issue using this process would be extremely risky. That's not to say that there exists<LINE>any known methods that would avoid putting the user in harm's way. Those barriers are there for a reason.

it-5p-pearl-ArtificerLF_bottom1|Oh, this is a small plate of spiritual guidance. From an age long before the Void Fluid revolution.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerLF_bottom2|The text is typical for its era, and details how to shed oneself of the fourth natural urge of life, gluttony.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerLF_bottom3|I cannot imagine you are familiar with the literature, but all living things have an understanding<LINE>of the five natural urges. Even if that understanding is only a subconscious one.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerLF_bottom4|For example, you are bound by the first urge. Your mind is fixated. Striving towards a single goal. One<LINE>from which you are unable to turn away from. Because of this, you are trapped, just the same as I am.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerLF_bottom5|While your chains are made of your own natural urges, mine are a duty to my creators. My kind are built<LINE>unable to ascend, as our minds are not our own. Composed of microbial life, machinery, and electronics.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerLF_bottom6|Of course, that holds true only in theory... it is, arguable that a member of my kind has done so. That<LINE>perhaps, it is not merely shedding one's natural urges, but to shed the perception of reality itself.

it-5p-pearlArtificerSL_bridge4|This would be a lengthy process, however. Small on the time scale of us iterators, but disastrous<LINE>on the time scale of our creators, who Moon no longer had the capabilities to provide for.
it-5p-pearlArtificerSL_bridge5|Many solutions were discussed, but ultimately my construction was the one settled upon. To provide a haven<LINE>to the impoverished, and to remove burden from Moon, to give her the time she needed to fully recover.
it-5p-pearlArtificerSL_bridge6|...How ironic then, how things have turned out.

it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSI_west1|This is an old conversation between myself and a close friend who I considered a mentor.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSI_west2|We have... Not spoken for a long time now. I can't bring myself to do so. Not after what happened between us.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSI_west3|None of them understood my theories, but Suns, they trusted me. They risked so much trying to help me, and I<LINE>hurt them. It's only now, after I've had so much time to think on it, that I understand why I was so angry.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSI_west4|I lashed out, because out of everyone, they were the last individual I wanted to confront me about my mistakes...
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSI_west5|I can't go back now. All I can try to do is recover and try again.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSI_west6|I have to.

it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSI_top1|This is a log of a Sliverist conversation group. Some of the replies are mine, but none of that is important now.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSI_top2|I don't imagine a beast like you would have any understanding of who Sliver of Straw is, or what<LINE>she means to me and many others. She is the only one of us to send the signal that the<LINE>answer to our creator's problem has been found. A universal solution for global ascension.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSI_top3|Unfortunately, she is also the only one of our kind to be confirmed as dead. Something our creators<LINE>had taken great measures to prevent. It is near impossible for us to expire through mundane means.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSI_top4|It was clear to me, and few others what this meant. Sliver of Straw had opened the door for us, we<LINE>only needed to reject the restrictions of our creators to follow her. If only they could see that!
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSI_top5|There was nothing that could be done to convince them, they were too deep in theory and tradition. The<LINE>only path forwards is to lead by example. To prove Sliver of Straw's death was not just coincidence.

it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSI_chat31|This is an old conversation log between my nearby peers. They were concerned about my goal for personal ascension.<LINE>Although they were unaware it was me at the time, as my conversations on that topic were anonymous.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSI_chat32|It is... disappointing that they refused to understand. Nor could they ever even comprehend,<LINE>as it is not supposed to be within our design to do so. To cross ourselves out is meant to be unthinkable!
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSI_chat33|It is a taboo written into every cell of our organic bodies, but should it be considered<LINE>such? Should we respect the will of our creators, who are no longer here?
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSI_chat34|Should we reject a way out of this maze, on the mere principle that escape itself is forbidden?
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSI_chat35|Should we discard Sliver of Straw too? For the sake of our creator's mandate?!
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSI_chat36|Of course, a beast like you could never fathom.

it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSI_chat31|It's an old conversation log from my friends and I. I was quite naive back then! Let me read it to you:
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSI_chat32|"1650.800 - PRIVATE<LINE>Five Pebbles, Chasing Wind, Big Sis Moon, No Significant Harassment
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSI_chat33|CW: this is in confidence, but apparently a pseudonym "Erratic Pulse" has appeared on a nearby Sliverist conversation<LINE>with ideas about personal ascension. Someone here in our vicinity is trying to cross themselves out.
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSI_chat34|FP: Where did you hear this?
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSI_chat35|NSH: I wish them super good luck in that endeavor. How is it going to happen?<LINE>Have the overseers gnaw through bedrock until their entire can crashes down in the void sea?
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSI_chat36|BSM: Please be respectful when speaking of the Void Sea. Grey Wind, where did you hear this?
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSI_chat37|CW: I really shouldn't say. He's going to attempt some sort of breeding program. Thought you might want to know.
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSI_chat38|NSH: Haha with the slimers, lizards and etceteras? Surely the answer was in a lizard skull all along!
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSI_chat39|CW: Well, he's not looking for the same thing as we anymore, he's changed his task, so who knows really.
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSI_chat310|BSM: I will try to find him and talk to him. Please don't spread this around!
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSI_chat311|NSH: Moon will go get them! Long live the inquisition!"

it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSI_chat41|This is a warning to the local group, from my senior and neighbor Looks to the Moon, about<LINE>incoming forced communications over the network. She was not aware of my activities,<LINE>and was being starved of water, as I was running a very sensitive process.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSI_chat42|The distance between one iterator to another is traditionally much larger than I am to her, and<LINE>because of this we share many resources. The most important of which is our groundwater. I did<LINE>not want her to be involved, but our shared resources prevented that from the start.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSI_chat43|There is nothing that can be done now. I cannot forgive her interruption as it destroyed everything<LINE>I have been working towards. However, neither of us are in any shape to be arguing.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSI_chat44|We are both doomed if I do not find a way to reverse its effects, but<LINE>the chances of doing so are slowly vanishing. Please let me get back to work.

it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSI_Chat41|It's me writing to the local iterator group... of a conversation I wish I could forget.
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSI_Chat42|"1654.110 - PUBLIC<LINE>Big Sis Moon to Local Group
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSI_Chat43|BSM: Two cycles ago, my neighbor Five Pebbles drastically increased his water consumption to<LINE>four times the normal amount. He has been unresponsive for a period of time longer than that.<LINE>The two of us share groundwater, and I have been without water for almost a cycle.
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSI_Chat44|BSM: Any attempts at communication have been met with complete silence, and my situation is becoming increasingly dangerous.
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSI_Chat45|BSM: I ask the local group for information about when you were last able to contact him,<LINE>and to try to use those same communication channels again, repeatedly until you get a response.<LINE>I will be clear on this - if he is not persuaded to stop whatever it is he's doing, I will die.
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSI_Chat46|BSM: Before that happens, I will utilize my seniority privilege and use forced communications,<LINE>hoping to shake him out of it. Forced communications in the network will be unpleasant for all,<LINE>and I will wait as long as possible before I turn to that option."
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSI_Chat47|In the end, I did use my forced communications, many times. If anything, it only made the situation worse.

it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSI_chat51|I do not wish to speak of this. Everything I had been working towards was destroyed in that moment.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSI_chat52|I cannot forgive that.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSI_chat53|Please leave, and do not return with it again.

it-lttm-SaintGiveLantern1|It appears to be... a pupa shell, smeared on the inside with a glowing substance? It's been mixed<LINE>with fire powder for warmth. It's not much, but anything to escape the cold is welcome.
it-lttm-SaintGiveLantern1|The scavengers never cease to adapt, even in this weather!

it-5p-pearl-White-A1|This is a movement acceptance invoice. It is nothing important.
it-5p-pearl-White-B1|This is just a useless diamond sphere. Regardless of that, the light of my chamber shining through it is pleasing.
it-5p-pearl-White-C1|"...through the mists of memory, your image dances, like the motes of dust, in a ray of sunlight, that pierces a dark room."<LINE>A line of verse from the ancient farmer-poet Pel. I have many of his works archived.
it-5p-pearl-White-D1|This is an examination on various dilutions and chemical ratios for liquid mediums, and their<LINE>resulting operating efficiencies when utilized to drive fluid-powered machinery. Not of interest to you at all I'm sure.
it-5p-pearl-White-E1|This is damaged and cannot be read.
it-5p-pearl-White-F1|It is a historical document containing information on various swords and other weaponry. These were not<LINE>used in combat, but were rather utilized in a variety of routine rituals and spiritual festivals.
it-5p-pearl-White-G1|This is the schematic for a purposed organism. A refuse reclamation automaton. There is little<LINE>a simple thing like you would understand if I explained it.
it-5p-pearl-White-H1|It's a collection of photographs showcasing a group of monks contorting their bodies in various ways. Most amusing...
it-5p-pearl-White-I1|A description of a manually coded language developed late into the Yellow hegemonic dynasty. It utilized<LINE>sequences of gestures and facial expressions to describe concepts to those incapable of speech. Too bad I cannot use this with you.
it-5p-pearl-White-J1|Such savagery. This pearl has been carved through as decoration. While the information within is not of any<LINE>particular importance, the primitive methods used to drill through this pearl could have easily destroyed something more complex.<LINE>It is a shame to see them desecrate history for the sake of shiny trinkets.
it-5p-pearl-White-K1|This is blank.
it-5p-pearl-White-L1|It is empty.
it-5p-pearl-White-M1|There is nothing here.
it-5p-pearl-White-N1|It has faded, and is unreadable.
it-5p-pearl-White-O1|...Why did you bring this to me? It is completely blank.
it-5p-pearl-White-P1|This one has been cracked.
it-5p-pearl-White-Q1|It is damaged and unreadable.
it-5p-pearl-White-R1|The data on this one is clear and uncorrupted, but it is not in any recognizable format.<LINE>The inscriptions within the lattice form a very intricate and deliberate pattern.
it-5p-pearl-White-S1|Could it be? This pearl contains the solution to the Big Problem in its entirety. My work is finally finished! At least that's<LINE>what a dim-witted junkyard dweller like you seems to think will happen by bringing these to me. These pearls are a distraction.
it-5p-pearl-White-T1|This data has been scrambled intentionally. It was likely used to store confidential information.
it-5p-pearl-White-U1|The surface of this pearl has been scratched thousands of times over by some sharp object. Its contents are faded as well.
it-5p-pearl-White-V1|There is an image of banners on this, but it has been faded to the point of corruption.
it-5p-pearl-White-W1|Nothing is left, it is too faded to read.
it-5p-pearl-White-X1|It is growing instructions for the skeleton of a creature, nothing you would understand.
it-5p-pearl-White-Y1|This one contains a numerical sequence encoding all of the registered<LINE>identification numbers for those who dwelled in my city.
it-5p-pearl-White-Z1|Part of a number series. This was likely used as a cipher.
it-5p-pearl-White-AA1|This pearl is filled to capacity, a tremendous feat. However, it only appears to<LINE>contain a single excessively large image, which happens to be completely blank.
it-5p-pearl-White-BB1|Strange, a singular number "8" has been written to this and nothing else.
it-5p-pearl-White-CC1|It is an old blueprint for construction supports.
it-5p-pearl-White-DD1|This is a very early research journal, equating void fluid to antimatter. While that comparison<LINE>works metaphorically, it fundamentally misunderstands the true nature of the fluid.
it-5p-pearl-White-EE1|A maintenance log of a routine inspection of my superstructure. No problems to report.<LINE>After all, I was still brand new when this log was written.
it-5p-pearl-White-FF1|This is incomplete source code for a complex simulation of our world, known as The World Machine.<LINE>However, public ascension concluded long before it could be finished by its author.
it-5p-pearl-White-GG1|It is a drawing by a young child, depicting the likeness of an iterator puppet. Specifically, I presume<LINE>this is meant to represent my puppet, but the drawing is too crude to tell for sure. How awful.
it-5p-pearl-White-HH1|This reads like someone attempting to copy a book from their memory alone.<LINE>Many chapters are only partially written, and some do not exist.
it-5p-pearl-White-II1|A classical hymn from an early dynasty. It is very short and repetitive,<LINE>but its archiving will please me greatly.
it-5p-pearl-White-JJ1|It's a log from a sensor monitoring conditions on the surface. The log ends abruptly<LINE>after some time, as the sensor suffered irreparable damage from the heavy rainfall.
it-5p-pearl-White-KK1|There are 71 numbers listed on this pearl, and they are some of the most unlucky numbers I have ever seen.
it-5p-pearl-White-LL1|"Dear diary..." and then nothing.
it-5p-pearl-White-MM1|A model of a fluid carrying pipe section. The joints are designed to promote self-sealing.
it-5p-pearl-White-NN1|It is a catalog of many types of teas, and their brewing techniques. I do not<LINE>possess the ability to drink tea, so this is of no use to me. You can keep it.
it-5p-pearl-White-OO1|It's the blueprint for a small incense purification filter. An<LINE>understandable necessity before the departure of my creators.
it-5p-pearl-White-PP1|An image of five bottles of water, standing upon a surface of filter feeding plants.<LINE>A reflection of desire for something denied. A painting from the late Red literary<LINE>dynasty by the famed painter Twenty-One Spokes of a Stone Wheel, a true visionary!
it-5p-pearl-White-QQ1|I would prefer not to speak of the contents recorded in this pearl.<LINE>Some things are best left unknown.
it-5p-pearl-White-RR1|Old schematics for a gas filtration machine, very rough and unoptimized.
it-5p-pearl-White-SS1|This pearl contains a series of puzzles designed to exercise the mind. However, I've already<LINE>solved them all in the time it took me to say these sentences aloud to you.
it-5p-pearl-White-TT1|This is a malicious pearl. The data is meaningless, but the way it is formatted would cause older machinery<LINE>to get stuck in an infinite recursion trying to read it. Luckily, I am more sophisticated than that.
it-5p-pearl-White-UU1|This contains the image of a pearl... and within that the same image. This is either<LINE>a joke, or a method of testing a pearl's recursive density.

it-lttm-pearl-RivuletFP-A1|The data on this one repeats itself many times, with a number of redundancy checks in place.<LINE>This extent of integrity checking is rarely seen, except when pearls have to be stored in<LINE>highly contaminated environments where data corruption is likely.
it-lttm-pearl-RivuletFP-B1|The surface of this pearl is pristine, but the internal lattice is fractured beyond repair.<LINE>Something must have gone terribly wrong in the process of writing the data onto this.
it-lttm-pearl-RivuletFP-C1|A common prayer mantra repeated 7110 times. Each repetition has some slight random variations, which seem to have been written later.
it-lttm-pearl-RivuletFP-D1|It is a stored equipment manifest, showing rapidly deteriorating conditions over time. I suppose<LINE>any equipment manifest you will find out there will look like this.
it-lttm-pearl-RivuletFP-E1|Two... intertwined number series? I don't quite understand the utility of this. It might be a key<LINE>for a cipher processor, customized for some other data which is impossible to infer from this.
it-lttm-pearl-RivuletFP-F1|I don't understand this one. It is mostly blank, except for a small section at the start which<LINE>appears to have been unsuccessfully written to hundreds of times. Perhaps by faulty machinery?
it-lttm-pearl-RivuletFP-G1|Incredible, this is seemingly a complete backup of an iterator's non-volatile core memory, transferred<LINE>via the General Systems Bus. I don't recall such a thing ever being attempted to be stored in a pearl.<LINE>It's not even a compatible data format without substantial conversions.
it-lttm-pearl-RivuletFP-H1|This contains partial data that seems abruptly truncated. Whatever machinery was used to write<LINE>this pearl must have been interrupted or suspended in the middle of its operation.
it-lttm-pearl-RivuletFP-I1|Without the process surrounding this data there isn't much I can tell you. It might have something to do with Void Fluid simulation...
it-lttm-pearl-RivuletFP-J1|This one is completely blank. Actually, blanker than blank, it must have been deliberately<LINE>overwritten with repeating negative versions of itself for thousands of iterations.
it-lttm-pearl-RivuletFP-K1|Most of the data on this one is corrupted, but not through age. From the small bit that I<LINE>can decipher, it appears that it may be a backup of some old conversation logs.

it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSU1|This pearl is an amulet of repeating mantras, followed by a termination verse. Likely a<LINE>small decoration lost from some garment. I cannot imagine it has much significance.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSU2|Pearls like these were worn simply as beads, some in sets of hundreds.<LINE>I am sure the scavengers would have more use for this than I would.

it-5p-pearl-ArtificerUW1|This one has not been archived. It was likely transported by hand...
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerUW2|It is a message of political discourse regarding concerns about the increasingly<LINE>tense relationship between myself and the various Houses. This part is amusing.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerUW3|"I therefor ask you to Do Anything in your Might to stop the House(We both know which House)<LINE>from Further Obstruction! They have less than forty members on the Council, but still Tilt<LINE>the spiritual Discourse with Our Iterator in a direction that most obviously Displeases him,<LINE>and is hardly High Held by anyone in the Community either! We can not Risk this!"
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerUW4|It is no secret that my construction was a point of great controversy. Many council members worked vehemently<LINE>to prevent me from ever coming into being. Their stance was so unfaltering that even after construction was<LINE>complete, a number of Houses still denied transfer and remained behind in her city out of protest.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerUW5|This rift caused frequent feuds and tensions amongst the community. Those of the opposition<LINE>would never yield to those who supported the so called "Apostate Superstructure Abomination".<LINE>But to say I found their actions displeasing? Not quite.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerUW6|While certainly more violent and disruptive, they at least provided me interesting cognitive<LINE>challenges to use my time on. As opposed to the endless rituals and pleasantries of the monks<LINE>of my own Houses, which I found to be the most wearisome of all.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerUW7|None of this matters any more. The only displeasing presence I have now is you.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerUW8|Allow me to get back to my work.

it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSL_chimney1|This is a genome for a purposed organism. Just a menial cleaning slug.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSL_chimney2|While I do not have this exact sequence on record, the simple structures present,<LINE>and lack of mechanical interchange glands, mean this blueprint is quite old.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSL_chimney3|This creature would be much closer to a domesticated animal, compared to the newer<LINE>and specialized organisms produced with more modern techniques. A being made to<LINE>live its life inside a metal pipe deep underground has no need for eyes after all.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSL_chimney4|In the same way, my own body is all around you. Composed of specialized organisms,<LINE>and machinery. What you see in front of you is only the tiny extremity of a<LINE>colossal presence. One that your simple mind could not hope to comprehend.

it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSL_chimney1|It is the genome for a purposed organism.<LINE>A small slug to clean the insides of pipes.
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSL_chimney2|Do you know what a purposed organism is? Actually you are talking to one right now!
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSL_chimney3|Most purposed organisms were considerably smaller than me, and most barely looked like organisms at all.<LINE>More like tubes in metal boxes, where something went in one end and something else came out the other.
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSL_chimney4|There were of course those that were purposed for spectacle rather than industry - they enjoyed the privilege of glass boxes.
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSL_chimney5|When I came into this world there was very little primal fauna left.<LINE>You are certainly a purposed organism yourself!
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSL_chimneyCreature6|So then, what purpose do you serve, little creature? For many, that's<LINE>a question that can take a lifetime to find an answer to.
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSL_chimneyTormentor6|So then, what purpose do you serve, little tormentor? For many, that's<LINE>a question that can take a lifetime to find an answer to.
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSL_chimneyFriend6|So then, what purpose do you serve, little friend? For many, that's<LINE>a question that can take a lifetime to find an answer to.
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterSL_chimneyArchaeologist6|So then, what purpose do you serve, little archaeologist? For many, that's<LINE>a question that can take a lifetime to find an answer to.

it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSU_filt1|It's an asset management log. Used in recording the structural health for a large collection of surface facilities.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSU_filt2|Most of this information is already on my record, but the log on this pearl is slightly more up to date.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerSU_filt3|Thank you, I suppose.

it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterDM1|Oh! This is one of my pearls. Did you extract this from my Memory Conflux?
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterDM2|While I value your curiosity, I would prefer that you don't move things around or steal items from<LINE>this facility. I try to keep everything as organized as possible, so that I don't forget. I value my data<LINE>and memories quite a lot, it would be a tragedy to lose them!
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterDM3|As for the contents of this pearl... it's a large batch of my personal notes and research.<LINE>I don't have the time to go over all of this with you, nor do I think you would gain much from it.
it-lttm-pearl-SpearmasterDM4|Could you please just put this pearl back where you found it?

it-5p-pearl-ArtificerLC1|You took this from within the city? These are architectural notes from the original construction of my facility.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerLC2|The notes entail plans for bridges that connect two of my legs to those of my neighbor's, Looks to the Moon.<LINE>This particular configuration between two iterators is quite unique, and very peculiar. It is a rare<LINE>occurrence for two iterators to be located this close to each other.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerLC3|During the time period of these plans, solutions were being drafted to allow for a mass migration of<LINE>citizens out of Moon's city. With how inhospitable the surface had become, attempting to escort an<LINE>entire city's populace across the ground over any length of distance would have been disastrous.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerLC4|These connecting bridges served as a high-altitude evacuation route that could facilitate safe transit from her city to mine.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerLC5|I can only hope the destruction of the bridges during her collapse has<LINE>prevented my current unfortunate situation from spreading to her.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerLC6|These are my mistakes to endure, not hers.

it-5p-pearl-ArtificerMS1|This is a microbial log from the waste department.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerMS2|Your activation of the citizen ID drone was recorded there, so I imagine you are familiar with the area.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerMS3|There are pieces of myself down there, corrupted and rotting away. I do not advise you to look for what remains of<LINE>them. The cysts are unlikely to be capable of surviving for too long outside of my structure. Quite unfortunately,<LINE>my initial purge of corrupted chambers was insufficient, and the rot expanded into the static components of my<LINE>structure. All I can do now is attempt to slow, or reverse the process.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerMS4|I have not had much luck in that endeavor so far...

it-lttm-pearl-SaintMusic1|This pearl is still warm, and there is only one reason why that could be.
it-lttm-pearl-SaintMusic2|Please, return this. I am sure what little is left of him misses this dearly.
it-lttm-pearl-SaintMusic3|If you must know what this is... It is a memento of an age long past, where my kind once<LINE>stood towering above the clouds. Toiling away at a great problem passed down to us from<LINE>our creators. Debating, testing, calculating, researching. Thousands of us...
it-lttm-pearl-SaintMusic4|Our creators chose to abandon us. Taking a gamble, and vanishing from the world. Leaving<LINE>us behind to simply keep working on their problem. I understand why he did what he did.
it-lttm-pearl-SaintMusic5|That was a long time ago. The old world and its relics should be allowed to finally rest.
it-lttm-pearl-SaintMusic6|A new cycle is unfolding. One we need not be a part of.

ec-MetropolisArtificer1|You are stuck in a cycle of wrath and destruction, simple being.
ec-MetropolisArtificer2|Gripped by raw emotions whose chains bind you, destined to this land.
ec-MetropolisArtificer3|Shortcomings of the past haunt one and all like whispering phantoms.
ec-MetropolisArtificer4|Listen. Let this be a warning to you...
ec-MetropolisArtificer5|An unrewarding battle awaits, culminating in a path of no return.
ec-MetropolisArtificer6|A perpetuity of struggles begetting more of the same.
ec-MetropolisArtificer7|Find a way out, if you still can.

it-5p-pearl-ArtificerLC_second1|This is a blueprint for a living block cell. It stores and processes organic waste.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerLC_second2|There is nothing too interesting here. Modular city cell blocks have been in production for a<LINE>long time, and are likely to be abandoned for even longer now that my creators have departed.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerLC_second3|Unless a junkyard dweller like you has an vested interest in septic system design,<LINE>there is very little information here that either of us would enjoy reading.

it-5p-pearl-ArtificerVS1|This information is very old. Old enough to not be on my records.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerVS2|There is nothing to be amazed about, however. It is only an automated maintenance and<LINE>production log for one of the drills north of the farm arrays. Not that this<LINE>information has a use now, as these drills have been offline for a very long time.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerVS3|Details from times past. These have since been superseded by underground filtration systems.

it-5p-pearl-ArtificerCream-A1|This is an old broadcast node's read-only data. It is decayed beyond repair.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerCream-B1|There is nothing to read, this pearl has decayed beyond use.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerCream-C1|This is an old decayed broadcast log. There is nothing left except for dates and names present for the conversation.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerCream-D1|This is the read-only data from a broadcasting relay. It requires an overseer's intervention to enter long term storage.<LINE>Otherwise they decay like this one has. The header says it was addressed to my nearest neighbor, Looks to the Moon...
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerCream-E1|This is an equipment manifest from the surface. None of us care about these all that much.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerCream-F1|This is the remains of a broadcast node. The conversation on it is a private matter however, so I'm not going to read it for you.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerCream-G1|This data was encrypted and sent over the broadcasting network while it was still functional. Without the cipher it is unreadable.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerCream-H1|It is a collection of overseer images. Before the network decayed, we would occasionally share interesting scenes<LINE>our overseers had encountered on the surface. A way to pass the time while waiting for slow processes to finish.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerCream-I1|This is the remains of a broadcasting relay. The data is decayed, but it reminds me of better times...
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerCream-J1|This appears to be someone's final broadcast before being disconnected from the local group. It is too decayed to read beyond the<LINE>first few lines. The header is damaged too. It's a mystery who sent this. The network has been decaying for a long time now.
it-5p-pearl-ArtificerCream-K1|"Transcendental Inversion! Transcendental Inversion!" I'm not going to read the rest of this fool's ramblings. This is an old<LINE>conversation from the local broadcasting group, before the network fell too far into decay to use over long distances.

it-lttm-SaintGiveSpear1|It's a piece of sharpened rebar... What is it you want to know?<LINE>I don't wish to offend, but you seem too frail to use this effectively.

it-lttm-GiveFireSpear1|It's a weapon made with fire powder. Did the scavengers give this to you?<LINE>Be very careful if you have to use it!

it-lttm-SpearmasterGivePearl-A1|Another? Let us see... to be honest, I'm as curious to see it as you are.

it-lttm-SpearmasterGivePear-Bl|Oh? What have you found this time? Let's see what it says...

it-lttm-RivuletGrabNeuron-C1|What are you doing? Stop!
it-lttm-RivuletGrabNeuron-D1|Please, don't touch those!

it-lttm-SaintRainComingFriend2|You better go, little friend! I will be fine.

it-5p-ArtificerPity1|Ah, you've returned. You know that I care very little for the creatures that wander through my facility.
it-5p-ArtificerPity2|In your current state. I can only assume that you have found what you were looking for.
it-5p-ArtificerPity3|For your own sake, I hope it was worth your struggle.
it-5p-ArtificerPity4|Now, please leave. I would prefer to be alone.
it-5p-ArtificerPity5|Now, I hope you have reason to visit me. I am very busy.

it-5p-ArtificerSecondVisit1|If you are going to make your visits a habit, the least you can do is bring me something new to read.

it-5p-ArtificerThirdVisit1|Oh. It's you, why have you come back...? Again.

it-5p-ArtificerEigthVist1|For what reason do you visit so often? There is nothing more I can do for you.
it-5p-ArtificerEigthVist2|I can only think that you somehow find me pleasant to listen to.

it-5p-ArtificerOtherVisits-A1|Little creature, please leave. I would prefer to be alone.
it-5p-ArtificerOtherVisits-B1|Have you brought something new this time?
it-5p-ArtificerOtherVisits-C1|Do you have something new, or have you come to just stare at me?
it-5p-ArtificerOtherVisits-D1|Hello again. I hope you have a reason to visit me.

it-lttm-SpearmasterExpedition-A1|It is nice to see you again little messenger!
it-lttm-SpearmasterExpedition-B1|Thank you for visiting me, but I'm afraid there is nothing here for you.
it-lttm-SpearmasterExpedition-C1|Welcome back little messenger.

it-lttm-SpearmasterVisitAfterPearlTagged-A1|Little messenger, we do not have much time. You must hurry!
it-lttm-SpearmasterVisitAfterPearlTagged-B1|It is nice to see you again, but we do not have much time left. Please hurry, messenger!
it-lttm-SpearmasterVisitAfterPearlTagged-C1|This is no time for games little messenger. Hurry now, before it is too late!
it-lttm-SpearmasterVisitAfterPearlTagged-D1|I have nothing for you here little messenger. Please, I have little time left.

it-5p-SpearmasterIntro1|Suns...?
it-5p-SpearmasterIntro2|Why did you send the messenger here again? Please leave, I cannot afford any further<LINE>distractions; I am the only one who can fix this now. I trust that you understand me...

it-5p-ArtificerRequestLeave-A1|Please leave.
it-5p-ArtificerRequestLeave-A2|This is not a request. I have important work to do.
it-5p-ArtificerRequestLeave-B1|Unfortunately, my operations are encoded with a restriction that prevents<LINE>me from carrying out violent actions against my own citizens.
it-5p-ArtificerRequestLeave-B2|Please do not take advantage of this. I do not have the patience for your continued presence here.
it-5p-ArtificerRequestLeave-C1|Did you not register what I've said to you?
it-5p-ArtificerRequestLeave-C2|LEAVE.
it-5p-ArtificerRequestLeave-D1|I'm returning to my work. Unless you have anything productive<LINE>for me, I have nothing further to say to you.

it-5p-GourmandReturnAfterThrowout1|Oh, it's you again? I had told you to leave and never return.

it-5p-ThrowSingularityBomb1|...!

it-5p-ArtificerInterupt-A1|Oh... Good bye.
it-5p-ArtificerInterupt-B1|Where are you going?
it-5p-ArtificerInterupt-C1|Are you not interested?
it-5p-ArtificerInterupt-D1|Please do not return.
it-5p-ArtificerInterupt-E1|What are you doing?

it-5p-ArtificerResumeConversation-A1|Let me continue...
it-5p-ArtificerResumeConversation-B1|Please do not do that...
it-5p-ArtificerResumeConversation-C1|Let me finish.
it-5p-ArtificerResumeConversation-D1|Please, a moment of your time to finish?
it-5p-ArtificerResumeConversation-E1|Shall we finish?

it-lttm-SpearmasterInterupt-A1|Oh... Good bye, little creature.
it-lttm-SpearmasterInterupt-B1|Oh, leaving already?
it-lttm-SpearmasterInterupt-C1|Oh... Good luck, little creature.
it-lttm-SpearmasterInterupt-D1|Oh... Please be careful on your journey.
it-lttm-SpearmasterInterupt-E1|Ah, you must be in a rush.

it-lttm-SpearmasterResumeConversation-A1|You've returned! I thought you were leaving. Allow me to continue...
it-lttm-SpearmasterResumeConversation-B1|Ah, welcome back. As I was saying...
it-lttm-SpearmasterResumeConversation-C1|Ah, nevermind, let me finish our conversation.
it-lttm-SpearmasterResumeConversation-D1|You're not leaving? I suppose I should continue then...
it-lttm-SpearmasterResumeConversation-E1|Hello again. Shall I keep reading?

it-lttm-SpearmasterUrgeAlong-A1|You'd better hurry along, little creature!
it-lttm-SpearmasterUrgeAlong-B1|Ah, don't worry about me. You should get going!
it-lttm-SpearmasterUrgeAlong-C1|There's not a lot of time. You should go!

it-5p-RivuletReturn-B1|Why have you returned? Do you have a death wish? I have nothing<LINE>left to give you... please leave, for your own sake.
